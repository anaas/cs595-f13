            <h2>The Road to Recovery: Nurses Play Critical Role in Post-Stroke Rehabilitation </h2>
            <p>According to the <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/poststrokerehab.htm" target="_blank">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</a>, more than 700,000 people suffer from stroke each year in the United States, and approximately two-thirds of those individuals survive and require rehabilitation. Although rehabilitation does not entirely cure the effects of stroke in patients with brain damage, it can substantially help stroke survivors relearn necessary skills and achieve the best possible long-term outcome.</p>
            
<p>“The primary goal of rehabilitation is to help patients become as independent as possible to promote recovery and prevent secondary complications,” said Michelle Camicia, MSN, RN, CRRN, president of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses (ARN). “Rehabilitation nurses can help patients achieve that independence by educating them and their caregivers about life after stroke, as well as ways to reduce risk factors that may lead to further complications, including another stroke.”</p>

<p>According to Camicia, as the length of stay in acute care hospitals has shortened in the past few decades, the demand for post-acute care for stroke patients has increased. Yet, studies have shown that sometimes there is a delay between stroke onset and transfer to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital (IRH), which has often been associated with poorer outcomes after stroke rehabilitation. </p>

<p>To further investigate the correlation of IRH admission timing and functional outcomes for patients, Camicia and her colleagues conducted a study, published in the <em><a href="http://www.pmrjournal.org/article/S1934-1482%2811%2900003-7/abstract" target="_blank">Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation</a></em> in 2011, that measured the change in total, motor and cognitive Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores of stroke patients between IRH admission and discharge. The study found that patients – even those with very severe impairments – experienced better functional outcomes after early admission to IRHs. </p>

<p>“These findings point to the importance of early admission to a rehabilitation facility after stroke,” said Camicia. “However, it’s equally as important for nurses to act quickly as soon as a stroke patient is admitted to the hospital setting. Prompt and comprehensive evaluation of presenting signs and symptoms once a patient is admitted to a hospital can make a significant difference in a patient’s recovery.”</p>

<p>According to the NINDS, a neurological exam to evaluate vision, movement, sensation and language is vital to preserving function and minimizing devastating side effects of stroke. One such tool that nurses can use to measure brain function in a post-stroke patient is the <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/doctors/NIH_Stroke_Scale.pdf" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</a>, a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. </p>

<p>“The NIHSS scale is designed to be a simple tool that can be administered at the bedside by nurses and other rehabilitation and medical staff. It provides valuable information that can help the treatment team predict long-term patient outcomes,” said Camicia. “It also serves as a data collection tool for planning patient care and provides a common language for information exchange among healthcare providers.”</p>

<p>Rehabilitation nurses play several roles in the post-stroke rehabilitation process. They can serve as teachers, educating patients not only how to prevent secondary complications, but also how to live with a new disability or injury; they act as facilitators of personal recovery and multidisciplinary care; they advocate for survivors’ return to independent living; and they can provide support for patients and their families.</p>

<p>For more information about the role of rehabilitation nurses in post-stroke rehabilitation, visit the ARN website at <a href="http://www.rehabnurse.org" target="_blank">www.rehabnurse.org</a>. And be sure to register for the ARN’s 39th Annual Education Conference – “<a href="http://www.rehabnurse.org/uploads/files/pdf/conference2013.PDF" target="_blank">The Continuum of Care: Navigating the Road to Recovery”</a> – being held in Charlotte, N.C. from October 2-5. The conference will provide discussions on basic rehabilitation nursing knowledge and skills, recent developments in research and science, best practices and evidence-based recommendations.</p>

          <h1>Nursing Careers</h1>
            <h2>Rehabilitation Nursing: Education, Advocacy and Advanced Care</h2>
            <p>Whether helping a patient overcome a long-term chronic illness or a short-term physical disability, rehabilitation nurses can play a very important role in setting patients on a path to an independent and healthy life. Often spending quality one-on-one time with patients and their caregivers throughout the rehabilitation process, nurses are able to coordinate care between patients and their doctors to help develop effective recovery plans. </p>

<p>"As a rehabilitation nurse, you get to spend a lot of time with your patients and really grow to understand their needs. If a patient is dealing with something long-term or chronic, our job is to teach them how to live with that condition and have a good quality of life. It's difficult to do that without really getting to know the patient,” said Kristen Mauk, Ph.D., DNP, RN, CRRN, GCNS-BC, GNP-BC, FAAN, Kreft Endowed Chair for the Advancement of Nursing Science at Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Ind., and president-elect of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses (ARN). </p>

<p>According to a study published in <a href="http://www.nursingcenter.com/lnc/static?pageid=1017772" target="_blank"><em>Advances in Nursing Science</em></a> in 2010, nurses are vital to improving efficient recovery for their patients, as they are often the most consistently present healthcare professional throughout the phases of recovery. This one-on-one time creates an opportunity for rehabilitation nurses to develop relationships with their patients, helping them to truly understand their patients’ experiences and needs. </p>

<p>With that knowledge, nurses can then advocate for their patients when building recovery plans with the rest of the rehabilitation team, which is often made up of several members including a physical therapist, psychiatrist, primary care physician and other specialists, depending on a patient’s needs. Together, the rehabilitation team educates patients and their caregivers on how to live life with a disability and/or a debilitating chronic illness. </p>

<p>“In most acute care settings, the nurse's job is like giving a fish to a patient for dinner, but with rehabilitation nursing, we are truly teaching the patient how to fish," said Dr. Mauk. </p>

<p>In addition to the bond that they build with their patients, the importance of rehabilitation nurses also lies in their possession of a very advanced and specific set of skills that make them well-equipped to lead the rehabilitation process. One of the most important jobs of the rehabilitation nurse is to help oversee the health of his or her patients throughout the rehabilitation process, not only teaching and coaching them through recovery, but also being prepared to address health issues that arise in the meantime. </p>
 
<p>“Rehabilitation nurses work across various settings and have a variety of responsibilities,” said Dr. Mauk. “Some of us work in settings where we see patients for one or two weeks, while others work in nursing homes and often work with the same person for several years. In either case, our job is to improve that person’s quality of life through care and education.”</p>

<p>According to Dr. Mauk, while rehabilitation nurses most often work with patients over a  longer period of time than in acute care units, their roles and objectives are similar when caring for those in the short-term. However, short-term care requires a different level of focus when it comes to patient education. In fact, it often takes a patient a prolonged period of time to even understand that his or her illness or disability may not ever be completely cured. Once that is accepted, a nurse who only sees the patient for a brief period of time has to work on a much tighter timeline to educate the patient on recovery and independence.</p>

<p>“While this can present obvious challenges, rehabilitation nurses are in a great position to address this by helping patients connect with community resources once they leave the hospital,” said Dr. Mauk. “That is what is so unique about the rehabilitation nursing specialty – that patient connection. It’s our job to empower our patients to live the best quality of life possible, and we do all that we can to ensure that goal is achieved.” </p>

<p>To become a rehabilitation nurse, an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is required, as well as passage of the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). Nurses must then obtain certification by meeting practice requirements and passing a special certification exam through the Rehabilitation Nursing Certification Board (RNCB) before becoming a Certified Rehabilitation Registered Nurse (CRRN). Certification will then need to be renewed every five years in order to stay up-to-date on the latest practice techniques and research in rehabilitation nursing.</p>

          <h1>Get to Know</h1>
          <h2>2013 Amazing Nurse Gloria Kindzeka, RN, Hiawatha Home Care in Coon Rapids, Minn.</h2>
            <p><strong>Q. When did you decide to pursue a career in nursing and why?</strong>
          <p><strong>A. </strong>My nursing career started in 2006. I was inspired by my sister, who is a home health nurse. In Cameroon where I grew up, we do not have nursing homes or group homes, and we take care of our family members in the comfort of our own homes.</p>

<p>Growing up, I helped take care of sick relatives, neighbors and friends, so the decision to become a nurse was an easy one. I knew I would love to go through life taking care of those who are sick – especially those who are helpless. </p>
              
          <p><strong>Q. What do you enjoy most about your profession?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> The nursing profession gives me a chance to help someone who is in need, work for their best interest and hopefully contribute towards their improved health. It is often said that “health is wealth,” and being a nurse truly gives me the opportunity to help provide my patients with the greatest wealth of all – health. </p>

<p>It is such an amazing experience to bring a positive change to someone’s life. I like to see a positive outcome, and I enjoy seeing people smile again. Knowing that the care I provided changed someone's situation for the better makes me happy. It’s also very rewarding when I see how much my patients appreciate the little things I do while caring for them, like making them comfortable throughout the healing process.</p>

          <p><strong>Q. What advice would you offer to those interested in becoming a nurse?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> I would advise them first and foremost to view it as a vocation, not just an opportunity to make a living. Nursing is a profession that calls for people who truly love what they are doing – this love or passion translates to how your patients are treated. It’s important to have a lot of patience, practice active listening, be caring, and always plan to work above and beyond your nursing duties.</p>

          <p><strong>Q. How has nursing impacted your life?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> Nursing has given me a positive mindset. I truly appreciate the little things people do for me in life. I'm also more proactive – I think prevention and safety first. And more importantly, I don’t take good health for granted.</p>
              
<p><strong>Q. What does it mean to you to have been selected as the 2013 Amazing Nurse?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> I'm still stunned by the whole process! It's as if I'll wake up tomorrow and find out it was all a dream. Being selected as the 2013 Amazing Nurse is a great recognition in my professional life. There are many amazing nurses out there doing amazing things for patients every day, and for me to be selected is just unbelievable! </p>

<p>The disbelief has started to give way to a humbling feeling of gratitude, extreme happiness, excitement and joy. I want to say thank you to everyone for caring about nurses and taking the time to vote. There are some things in my life that will never go away, and one of them is the sense of gratitude I owe to the people that voted for me. It’s a reminder that I should continue to render only the very best care for my patients.

          <h1>Get to Know</h1>
          <h2>Marie Spencer, Ph.D., RN, CRRN, chief nursing officer at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital in White Plains, N.Y.</h2>
            <p><strong>Q. What inspired you to become a nurse?</strong>
          <p><strong>A. </strong>Being a nurse has been in my heart and soul for as long as I can remember. I was in an accident when I was 15-years-old that required extensive knee surgery, and ultimately required the pinning of my patella. I was inspired by the fantastic nurses that cared for me, both physically and emotionally, and I remember thinking that when I grew up I wanted to be just like them. I wanted my patients to love and admire me as much as I loved and admired my nurses. To this day, I try to emulate those wonderful nurses who took care of me.</p>
              
          <p><strong>Q. Why did you choose to enter the specialty of rehabilitation nursing?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> After 28 years of working in acute care, a wonderful opportunity came my way and I became the chief nursing officer at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital. Moving into the rehabilitation specialty has opened up many new opportunities to grow and learn. I thought I knew so much about nursing, only to find out that rehabilitation is a new and wonderful world to explore. </p>
              
<p>In nursing school we were taught the basics of care for spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, amputees and orthopaedic patients, but when you are a rehabilitation nurse, you learn that you not only need to know every aspect of care, but you must always be cognizant of the long-term recovery goals for each patient.</p> 

<p>Rehabilitation nursing is a specialty that offers a holistic approach. We care for patients with disabilities and chronic health problems, but have to keep in mind the ultimate goal of restoring, maintaining and promoting maximum health. It is a wonderful feeling to see the differences from the time a patient enters our facility, to when they have advanced and are ultimately discharged.</p>

          <p><strong>Q. What do you enjoy most about your profession?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A.</strong> I love the interaction with patients and families; the camaraderie with my team members; and seeing a patient’s progress. Most importantly, I want to make sure that I feel like I have made a difference in people’s lives.</p>
          
              <p>Nursing is one of the few professions where you can change job titles and responsibilities without leaving the profession. There is so much flexibility no matter your age or physical abilities. I truly love this profession, the staff and the patients I work with on a daily basis.</p>

          <p><strong>Q. What advice would you give students, or potential nursing students, interested in rehabilitation nursing?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A.</strong> Rehabilitation nursing is a wonderful specialty. However, the best piece of advice that I can give is for nurses to obtain a solid base of medical-surgical nursing experience before entering into the rehabilitation specialty. That experience alone will carry you through your career. </p>
              
<p>Also, never stop learning. There is always something new on the horizon. Whether you work in rehabilitation or any other field of nursing, it is vital to continue your education.</p>

          <h1>Ask a Nurse</h1>
            <h2>Learn from Industry Leaders How to Kick-Start Your Nursing Career</h2>
            <p>Attention all student nurses and new nurses – are you interested in learning how to expand your network, prep for interviews or gain valuable experience in nursing? Or maybe you want to know what to expect during your first year as a nurse. We are inviting student nurses and nurses with less than five years of nursing experience to share your fundamental questions with us on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jnjnursingnotes" target="_blank"><em>Nursing Notes</em> by Johnson & Johnson Facebook Page</a> and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jnjnursingnotes" target="_blank">@JNJNursingNotes</a>. Each month, we will pick a few questions to highlight in this section with responses provided by seasoned nurses!</p>

          <p><strong>Q. For recent nursing graduates searching for a job, is it more important for them to take any nursing position that might be available or hold out for their “dream job”?</strong>
          <p><strong>A. </strong>Many nurses these days are not content with just taking a job. They often value flexibility, good location and the best hours, and sometimes they want to see all of that right out of school. While those students may be waiting longer to accept a job, holding out can make them happier in the long run. I think it varies from nurse-to-nurse depending on his or her situation.</p>
          
          <p>While I don’t think it always makes sense to be too picky right out of school, nurses should always choose their jobs carefully. Even if your first job isn’t your ideal job – which can certainly be the case for many nurses – it should be a place that has a good mentoring program, and where new graduates are treated with respect. At the same time, some new nurses like to move around and experience different specialties and settings. Keeping an open mind can often open new doors and shine a new light into your passions in unexpected ways.</p>
          
          <p><em>-Kristen L. Mauk, Ph.D., DNP, RN, CRRN, GCNS-BC, GNP-BC, FAAN, Kreft Endowed Chair for the Advancement of Nursing Science at Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Ind., and president-elect of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses (ARN). Dr. Mauk has been a nurse for more than 30 years.</em></p>

<hr style="border:dashed #9B9B9B; border-width:1px 0 0; height:0;" />

<p><strong>Q. What advice would you give to recent nurse graduates preparing for their first interview?</strong>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Most nursing interviews today utilize a technique called behavioral interviewing, where the interviewer asks for examples of experiences the person has had in a variety of areas. It’s not so much focused on the theory itself, but more focused on actual life experiences that illustrate that theory. </p>

<p>In an interview, it’s important to think about situations where you may have had a really strong connection with a patient, or a time when you may have worked as a team or had to deal with a stressful situation. Those are the types of skill sets we are looking for in nurses. It’s not all about what you know – it’s more about how you work with people and how you provide care to your patients and their families.</p>
   
<p><em>-Michelle Camicia, MSN, RN, CRRN, president of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses (ARN). Camicia has been a nurse for 24 years.</em></p>

<hr style="border:dashed #9B9B9B; border-width:1px 0 0; height:0;" />

<p><strong>Q. What advice would you give to new nurses on how to maintain a work-life balance?</strong>
<p><strong>A.</strong> First, leave your personal problems at home and your professional business at work. Don’t mix the two together. You need the luxury of a personal life that has love and fun in it. Next, “lighten up” – it’s OK to like your work and have fun while still maintaining a professional demeanor. Keep your colleagues close to you. You will always need someone to lean on, especially when you experience a patient trauma or death that is hard to deal with. Remember that you too have feelings and emotions, and talk to your co-workers when you need support.</p>

<p>It’s important that you wake up every morning wanting to go to work. When that feeling is gone, it is time to transition elsewhere. But if you do experience burn-out, don’t leave the profession. There is such a wide variety of settings to choose from in nursing.</p>  

<p><em>-Marie Spencer, Ph.D., RN, CRRN, chief nursing officer at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital in White Plains, N.Y. Spencer has been a nurse for 40 years.</em></p>
