   Defense attorneys for the Guantanamo Bay detainees charged with
   plotting the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks told the court this
   week that the Wi-Fi connection at Starbucks was more secure than the
   Pentagonâs own system.

   Lawyers for the accused terrorists said in pretrial hearings previously
   that they often relied on the wireless Internet provided at coffee
   shops to conduct work over the Web, but on Thursday the attorneys went
   as far as to say that the Starbucksâ Wi-Fi was significantly the most
   secure connection available.

   Air Force Colonel Karen Mayberry, the chief defense counsel for the war
   crimes tribunal, told the judge that the Starbucks Wi-Fi was âthe best
   bad option that we had,â Jane Sutton reported for Reuters.

   Lawyers for the accused 9/11 masterminds asked the court before for
   more time to prepare their case, citing an inability to work
   efficiently on the Defense Departmentâs computer system.

   "We're basically put back in the 19th century," Army Major Jason
   Wright, the attorney for Khalid Sheik Mohammed, said last month. "It
   takes about five to 10 times what it would normally take to do defense
   functions.â

   Army Colonel James Pohl said at the time, "I understand the serious
   nature of being able to communicate as a defense counsel," and
   announced he would decide this week if hearings set for later this year
   should be postponed to provide attorneys more time.

   On Thursday, the lawyers said things havenât improved with regards to
   their computer issues.

   MayberryÂ acknowledged that the Starbucks Wi-Fi might be unsecure but,
   according to Reuters, said she was certain the DoD network had been
   compromised. She told Pohl that computer files used by the defense have
   repeatedly gone lost, some were mysteriously altered and referenced
   instances in which government officials admitted to monitoring the
   Internet use of defense attorneys.

   "It's not speculative or hypothetical. It happened," she said.

   A day earlier, another attorney for Mohammed said he was questioned by
   the government about visiting terrorism-related websites. Mayberry said
   that the pages lawyer David Nevin and other members of the defense team
   visited were relevant to their work. On their part, the Defense
   Department said it has systems in place to flag suspicious activity on
   the Pentagonâs systems.

   Given the issues that have plagued the attorneyâs ability to access the
   Internet so far, though, Mayberry said the problems created âan
   extremely difficult work environment,â and that âit has become a
   cumbersome process to complete even the most simple of tasks.â

   Nevin, Washington Postâs Billy Keber reported from Gitmo, said US
   intelligence services âhave an extreme interest in informationÂ in
   relation to the men who are the accused in this case.â It was
   [35]previously reported that fake smoke detectors at Guantanamo had
   been equipped with eavesdropping devices and that defense emails were
   handed over to the prosecution.

   According to Reuters, a logistic overseer said it could take over three
   months to fix the Pentagonâs system and was a matter of money. Internet
   technology supervisor Paul Scott Parr testified that the problems may
   have occurred due to a switch in the email system used by attorneys, or
   perhaps an attempt to replicate their work on two computers networks â
   one based near Washington and another near the Cuban prison. Pohl said
   funding for the issues could be discussed in court in around two weeks.

   "According to Reuters, a logistic overseer said it could take over

   May I suggest that making at least some effort to trace the whereabouts
   of the 'missing 2.3 Trillion Dollars' would alleviate the money
   problem?
