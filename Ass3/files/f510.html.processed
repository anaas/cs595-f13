   Two suicide bombers detonated their explosives outside a historic
   church in Pakistan today killing 85 people in the deadliest-ever attack
   on the country's Christian minority.

   The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing in the
   city of Peshawar, saying it would continue to target non-Muslims until
   the US stopped drone attacks in the country's remote tribal region.

   The latest drone strike came on Sunday when missiles hit a pair of
   compounds in the North Waziristan tribal area, killing six suspected
   militants, Pakistani intelligence officials said.

   The attack on All Saints Church, which also wounded 140 people,
   underlines the threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban at a time when the
   government is seeking a peace deal with the militants.

   The attack occurred as hundreds of worshippers were coming out of the
   church in the city's Kohati Gate district after services to get a free
   meal of rice.

   'There were blasts and there was hell for all of us,' said Nazir John,
   who was at the church with at least 400 other worshippers.

   'When I got my senses back, I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and
   screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.'

   Survivors wailed and hugged each other in the wake of the blasts. The
   white walls of the church, which first opened in the late 1800s, were
   pockmarked with holes caused by ball bearings or other metal objects
   contained in the bombs to cause maximum damage.

   Blood stained the floor and was splashed on the walls. Plates filled
   with rice were scattered across the ground.

   The attack was carried out by a pair of suicide bombers who detonated
   their explosives almost simultaneously. Authorities found body parts
   and have been trying to determine their age.

   The blasts killed 85 people and wounded another 140. The dead included
   women and children.

   The number of casualties from the blasts was so high that the hospital
   was running out of caskets for the dead and beds for the wounded, said
   Mian Iftikhar Hussain, a former information minister of surrounding
   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province who was on the scene.

   'This is the deadliest attack against Christians in our country,' said
   Irfan Jamil, bishop of the eastern city of Lahore.

   One of the wounded, John Tariq, who lost his father in the attack,
   asked of the attackers, 'What have we done wrong to these people? Why
   are we being killed?'

   Ahmad Marwat, who identified himself as the spokesman for the Jundullah
   wing of the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack.

   'All non-Muslims in Pakistan are our target and they will remain our
   target as long as America fails to stop drone strikes in our country,'
   Marwart told The Associated Press by telephone from an undisclosed
   location.

   Jundullah has previously claimed responsibility for attacks on minority
   Shiite Muslims in the southwestern Baluchistan province. Hard-line
   Sunni extremists like the Taliban consider Shiites to be heretics.

   The bishop in Peshawar, Sarfarz Hemphray, announced a three-day
   mourning period in response to the church attack and blamed the
   government and security agencies for failing to protect the country's
   Christians.

   'If the government shows will, it can control this terrorism,' said
   Hemphray. 'We have been asking authorities to enhance security, but
   they haven't paid any heed.'

   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack in a
   statement sent to reporters, saying, 'The terrorists have no religion
   and targeting innocent people is against the teachings of Islam and all
   religions.'

   'Such cruel acts of terrorism reflect the brutality and inhumane
   mindset of the terrorists,' he said.

   This does not make the news as the bombing on saturday because
   Christians it seems are dispensible, even the West hates true
   Christians and would glady lock them in a cage if they could because of
   the immoral things true Christians speak out against, there is a young
   doctrine from the Middle East which has poisioned the minds of many, it
   they keep preaching we are a religion of peace, but the fruits which it
   bear is nothing but death and distruction.

   Still no comments from The Most Rev Justin Welby or his trusted ally
   the Archbishop of York John Tucker Mugabi Sentamu. They can always be
   relied upon for a sound bite on any other subject, but nothing to say,
   no words of comfort or outrage at the persecution and murder of fellow
   Christians. Where is Mr. Hague to denounce this atrocity and offer
   assistance to defeat the perpetrators. This lack of leadership and
   statesmanship gives strength to these terrorist animals, as it shows
   weakness in the defence of those they terrorise.

   These so-called Taliban are ignorant, and no real muslims. The Koran
   explicitly says that if you kill one innocent person it's as if you
   killed a whole country. It also states that Christians are to be
   respected. ut never mind .... they do it to muslim worshippers in their
   own mosques, too....
