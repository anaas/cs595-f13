   query-encryption-not-provided-keywords The day many SEO professionals
   hoped would never come, but feared eventually would, apparently has
   arrived today. It appears that Google has cut off keyword data
   altogether.

   Nearly two years after making one of the [29]biggest changes to secure
   search that resulted in a steady rise in "(not provided)" data, Google
   has switched all searches over to encrypted searches using HTTPS. This
   means no more keyword data will be passed to site owners.

   Encrypted Google searches don't pass the keyword data through to
   websites, thereby eliminating the ability to track users by their
   keyword searches. The biggest impact for many site owners has been not
   being able to segment users by keywords within their web analytics
   software.

   To publish any intention of Google's motives for this move would be
   pure speculation. Not wanting to feed the rumor mill or feed any false
   speculation, Search Engine Watch has reached out to Google for a
   comment.

   "We added SSL encryption for our signed-in search users in 2011, as
   well as searches from the Chrome omnibox earlier this year," a Google
   spokesperson told Search Engine Watch. "We’re now working to bring this
   extra protection to more users who are not signed in."

   When encrypted search [30]initially launched in May 2010, Google
   initially had encrypted search on a separate URL. A year later, in late
   2011, Google started redirecting [31]all U.S. users who were signed
   into their Google Accounts to the encrypted version at
   https://google.com. This led to the now-infamous "(not provided)" row
   in keywords data in Google Analytics and other web traffic software
   packages.

   When questioned, Cutts was quick to respond that it was estimated that
   the amount of "(not provided)" visits "even at full roll-out ... would
   still be in the single-digit percentages of all Google searchers on
   Google.com."

   As time rolled on, the conversion to encrypted search expanded
   [32]globally to all signed-in users then even further to include
   [33]default searching in Firefox

   Just last month, BrightEdge released a study fining the percentage of
   "(not provided)" data was [34]over 50 percent for some industries.

   There are methods around [35]determining "(not provided)" data via
   Webmaster Tools. While the method isn't fullproof, it can be useful to
   determine trends.

   At this point, it seems even when you aren't logged in, using private
   browsing (or incognito mode) and forcibly type HTTP://www.google.com,
   you are being redirected to the HTTPS version, thereby encrypting your
   search and no doubt leading to a total removal of keyword data – at
   least from Google search visitors. Remember, keyword data from other
   search engines – like Bing, for example – still send keyword data
   through.

   If you're a practitioner, how will you be adjusting your strategies and
   practices? How will you begin the conversation with your clients? Sound
   off in the comments. We'll have reactions and more coverage as this
   story develops.
