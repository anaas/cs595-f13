   An Egyptian court has banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood
   in the country. Its assets will also be confiscated according to the
   court ruling.

   "The court bans the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood organization
   and its non-governmental organization and all the activities that it
   participates in and any organization derived from it," said the
   presiding judge Mohammed Sayed.Â

   The Cairo Court for Urgent Matters also ordered the "confiscation of
   all the group's money, assets, and buildings".

   The Cabinet has ordered the formation of an independent committee to
   manage the money until final court orders are issued.Â

   "This is totalitarian decision," leading group member Ibrahim Moneir
   told Al-Jazeera Mubashir Misr TV. "You are losers and it (the
   Brotherhood) will remain with God's help, not by the orders of the
   judiciary ofÂ  Sisi," he added, referring to the commander-in-chief of
   the Egyptian Armed Forces, who led the military-backed ouster of former
   presidentÂ Mohamed Morsi.

   The Brotherhood has been outlawed for most of its 85-year existence. It
   has been in its worst crisis since a similar attempt to suppress it in
   the 1950s.

   However, after the ouster of former long ruling President Hosni
   Mubarak, it formed a political party and organized post-Mubarak
   elections.

   In June 2012, the Muslim Brotherhoodâs Mohamed [32]Morsi won the
   presidential elections. However, on July 3 of this year the [33]army
   overthrew Morsi after he rejected the military's ultimatum to reach an
   agreement with Egypt's opposition. The constitution was also
   suspended.Â

   The crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood started shortly after the army
   announced a power take-over, with arrest warrants for hundreds of
   Brotherhood officials being issued.

   In March 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood registered as a recognized
   non-governmental organization in response to opponents who disputed its
   legal status in court.

   After suspension of the Islamistsâ constitution, Cairoâs administrative
   court and the Ministry of Social Solidarity were ordered to review the
   Brotherhood's legal status.

   Earlier in September, an Egyptian judicial panel recommended the legal
   dissolution of the Muslim Brotherhood as an officially registered
   non-governmental organization.

   The court decision, which can be appealed, is likely to drive more
   Brotherhood members underground and encourage young Islamists to rebel
   against the state.Â

   A spokesperson for the British Egyptians for Democracy activist group,
   Alaa Mohamed, says the courtâs decision is âunsurprisingâ and is
   politically motivated. This, she said, is just the start of a âa witch
   huntâ pursued against those who oppose the military coup.
   âThis is what all military coups do â as soon as they take power they
   go after every single political party that was opposing them,â Mohamed
   told RT. âThatâs what we have seen with the Muslim Brotherhood. And
   this is not about Muslim Brotherhood, this is about every single
   political, social party as well as individuals from all backgrounds
   that oppose the military coup.â
