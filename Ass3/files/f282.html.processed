   Knoji Q&A Ambassador Program Guidelines
   [386]x
   Asking questions
   Your primary job as an Ambassador is to kick off thoughtful discussion
   threads around products, services. Your discussions can be on any topic
   in Knoji's category system. Here are some examples of the types of
   discussions you'll be starting:
   Requests for recommendations for any type of product or service,
   examples:
     * [387]Which micro four thirds (mirrorless) DSLR camera offers the
       best performance for the price?
     * [388]Recommendations for a portable and lightweight baby jogging
       stroller?
     * [389]Best juicer for under $100?

   Advice to solve a specific problem, examples:
     * [390]Need a durable tablet (Android or iPad) that can handle water
       splashing on it, dirt and being dropped
     * [391]Solution for severe snoring issues?

   Answering questions
     * People on Knoji ask questions seeking recommendations for products
       and services. We encourage our community members to answer
       questions whenever you can make a useful recommendation towards any
       request.
     * When pointing to specific products, please link to specific product
       pages on [392]Amazon.com or [393]Walmart.com
     * UPDATE: Ambassadors earn bonuses for answering questions, however -
       only answers which include products links (as described above) will
       earn bonuses.
     * You should include screenshots of the products you recommend
       (Ambassadors: you earn increased rewards when doing this)
     * Try to recommend products that you've had personal experience with.
       If not, it is acceptable to recommend products or options based on
       thorough research you do online.

   Asking questions
   On Knoji, you can ask any question about any consumer or
   shopping-related topic. Many questions involve requests for
   recommendations for any type of product or service, examples:
     * [399]Which micro four thirds (mirrorless) DSLR camera offers the
       best performance for the price?
     * [400]Recommendations for a portable and lightweight baby jogging
       stroller?
     * [401]Best juicer for under $100?
     * Better questions are more specific. Drill down with as many
       specific criteria as possible in your questions for better results.

   Some questions ask for advice in solving a specific problem, examples:
     * [402]Need a durable tablet (Android or iPad) that can handle water
       splashing on it, dirt and being dropped
     * [403]Solution for severe snoring issues?

   What's a working, unique coupon?
   [405]x
   To qualify as a working coupon, the link or code must provide a
   discount above and beyond what's freely available by default on the
   vendor's site.
   To check this, first click the link and check that the coupon can be
   applied and does provide the discount described. Then, in a different
   browser, open the vendor's site (without using the Knoji link) and
   check whether that same discount is available to any user by default.
   If it's not, and the coupon works, then you've found a qualified coupon
   and can verify it and get your earnings. If not, you can verify that it
   does not work (explain why this is) and you'll earn a smaller credit.
   Don't waste your time verifying invalid coupons! Before you receive
   payment, all your verifications will be reviewed, and if they are
   invalid, you earnings will be deleted. Verify only valid coupons in
   order to receive payment for this project.
