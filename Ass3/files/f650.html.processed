     New Country For IAPCO - Malaysia
     _______________________________________________________________________

     Malaysia joins the ranks of IAPCO member countries with the recent
     addition of AOS Conventions & Events being accepted into membership.
     "We are delighted to welcome AOS" commented Gonzalo Perez Constanz√≥,
     "Malaysia is such an important meetings destination in Asia, it was
     always surprising that we were not represented there. They will be a
     much appreciated addition to our Asia contingent which is consistently
     growing and becoming an influential sector of IAPCO."
     "By joining IAPCO, we will now be recognised as a company providing
     professional conference management services, accredited by IAPCO, a
     globally recognised organisation," said Anthony Wong, President of AOS.
     "We believe that our company will enhance IAPCO's global outreach with
     local solutions, including the sharing of knowledge regarding doing
     business in Malaysia."
     "AOSCE believes that Malaysia is among the best destinations for
     Business Events" added Aldia Lai, General Manager, "A charming land of
     friendly people who provide a taste of Asia".
     IAPCO: Meeting Quality
     The International Association of Professional Congress Organisers
     (IAPCO) was founded in 1968, is registered in Switzerland and
     represents today more than 115 professional organisers, meeting
     planners and managers of international and national congresses,
     conventions and special events from 40 countries. IAPCO members
     organise in excess of 6600 meetings annually, totaling some 2.285
     million delegates and representing an economic impact in the region of
     3.71 billion euros.
     IAPCO is committed to raising standards of service among its members
     and other sectors of the meetings industry. Today IAPCO membership
     offers a unique quality assurance, since entry into membership of IAPCO
     is by meeting strict criteria and by continuous quality assessment.
     The high quality standards are secured by means of continuing education
     and interaction with other professionals. The 'Wolfsberg' Annual
     Seminar, The Meetings MasterClass and the Annual Meeting & General
     Assembly of its members are the highlight events of IAPCO.
