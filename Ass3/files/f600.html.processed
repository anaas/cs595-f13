Brian Banks – A Life Rediscovered

   Duration:
          55 minutes

   First broadcast:
          Saturday 21 September 2013

   Former Atlanta Falcons player Brian Banks spent five years in prison
   for rape and kidnap - a crime he did not commit. He tells us his
   amazing story from football field to jail cell and back again, on being
   an innocent man incarcerated, on being contacted by the woman who had
   falsely accused him - and his eventual and dramatic exoneration.
   Y Words Matter
   Should Tottenham fans continue to use the term ‘Yid’ or is it
   perpetuating the anti-Semitic abuse from some away fans? In the No
   camp, Professor Gavin Schaffer a social and cultural historian
   specialising in the history of race and immigration at the University
   of Birmingham and in the Yes camp, Swedish writer and broadcaster
   Nathalie Rothschild.
   E.A Sportshour… It’s in the game
   The world’s most successful sports computer game franchise releases its
   latest version next Friday. This date for many will be as exciting as
   the start of the season in real life. We hear from FIFA, EA Sports, the
   makers and Glen Haag from web site Sports gamer to preview the game and
   give us his top sports video games of all time
   From Our Own Correspondent
   Alex South is our sporting correspondent. He looks back on his week in
   Spain watching the Gareth Bale transfer and debut
   New Zealand’s America’s Cup
   New Zealand will celebrate long and hard if they win the America’s Cup,
   but scratch the surface and it is a victory of many contradictions as
   Steve Jackson, a professor specialising in the socio-cultural analysis
   of sport from the University of Otago, explains.
