     The sources said that the Qataris offered hundreds of millions of
     dollars in aid to Jordan in return for allowing Hamas to open
     offices in the kingdom. By rejecting these requests, King Abdullah
     has shown that he has no intention to serve as a lifesaver for
     failed Islamists who are facing growing opposition from their own
     people in the Gaza Strip.

   Jordan's King Abdullah has turned down a request from Hamas to re-open
   its offices in his country, according to informed sources in Amman.

   The sources said that Qatar, one of the few Arab countries that
   continue to support Hamas, recently asked King Abdullah to allow Hamas
   to resume its activities in the kingdom.

   The Jordanians banned Hamas in 1999 and stripped some of the Islamist
   movement's leaders, including Khaled Mashal, of their Jordanian
   citizenship.

   Last year, however, relations between Jordan and Hamas seemed to be
   warming up as Mashal was permitted to visit Amman and hold talks with
   King Abdullah.

   Hamas's hope that Mashal's visit would pave the way for the movement to
   return to Jordan have now been dashed as the monarch refused to allow
   the movement and its leaders to resume their activities there.

   The sources said that the Qataris offered hundreds of millions of
   dollars in aid to Jordan in return for allowing Hamas to open offices
   in the kingdom.

   "King Abdullah turned down the Qatari offer," the sources said.
   "Jordan's policy toward Hamas remains unchanged."

   The short-lived rapprochement between Hamas and Jordan was apparently
   linked to the king's fear of the Arab Spring, which saw the rise of
   Islamists in a number of Arab countries and emboldened the Muslim
   Brotherhood in Jordan.

   By inviting Mashal and other Hamas leaders to Jordan last year, King
   Abdullah was seeking to appease the Muslim Brotherhood, whose
   supporters were behind a wave of protests demanding reform and an end
   to corruption in the kingdom.

   The downfall of the Muslim Brotherhood regime in Egypt and growing
   disillusionment with Islamists throughout the Arab world have given
   King Abdullah enough confidence to turn his back, once again, on Hamas
   and their allies in the kingdom.

   The removal of President Mohamed Morsi from power has weakened and
   divided Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood. While some of the organization's
   leaders have called for reassessing their strategy in the wake of the
   failure of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, others have come out against
   King Abdullah for supporting the anti-Morsi "military coup."

   The divisions inside Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood are seen as good news
   for King Abdullah and bad news for Hamas.

   Muslim Brotherhood supporters are no longer staging weekly
   demonstrations throughout the kingdom to demand "reforms and
   democracy." The Arab Spring had triggered a series of rallies and
   marches that were organized by the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan,
   prompting many political analysts to predict that that the countdown
   for regime change in Amman had begun.

   At one point, King Abdullah expressed his concern over the Islamists'
   intentions when, in an interview with the Atlantic magazine, he
   described the Muslim Brotherhood as "wolves in sheep's clothing" and a
   "Masonic cult always loyal to their leader."

   Hamas, meanwhile, appears to have lost not only their patrons in Egypt,
   but also their political allies in Jordan. Hamas leaders in the Gaza
   Strip say they are fully aware of the "problems" facing the Muslim
   Brotherhood in Jordan. "We can't rely on their support because they
   have been affected negatively by the Egyptian crisis," admitted a Hamas
   representative.

   Hamas once had hopes that the Jordanian monarch would be foolish enough
   to allow the "wolves in sheep's clothing" to set foot in his country.

   By rejecting requests to allow Hamas to return to Jordan, King Abdullah
   has shown that he has no intention to serve as lifesaver for failed
   Islamists who are facing growing opposition from their own people in
   the Gaza Strip.

   Hamas is in big trouble and there is no reason why the Jordanians
   should come to the rescue. The downfall of Hamas will in fact serve the
   interest of the king and many Jordanians, as it will undoubtedly
   further undermine the Muslim Brotherhood in the kingdom.

[27]Al Qaeda Quickly Constructing Main Mideast Base in Syria

   by Yaakov Lappin

   Al Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's official arm in Syria, is quickly
   entrenching itself in the north and east of Syria, where the Assad
   regime's rule has collapsed. Jihad will spread outwards to the region,
   then threaten global security -- possibly with biological and chemical
   weapons.

[28]How Much for a Nuclear Deterrent?

   by Peter Huessy

   Major policy changes are masquerading as simple budget cuts. What is
   the right number of nuclear weapons? As many as lead the military
   planners in Russia and China to conclude, "Not today, comrade." There
   are no budget savings that could justify, after the fact, the cost of a
   nuclear exchange between superpowers.

[29]Al-Qaeda Terror Returns to Kenya

   by Irfan Al-Alawi

   Kenyan Islam was originally moderate, contemplative, and traditional;
   the very title of "Al Shabaab" [The Youth] indicates, since 2001, a new
   generation of extremists.

[30]Iceland to Get its First Mosque

   by Soeren Kern

   The Muslim Association of Iceland now admits that foreign donors will
   be paying for the mosque's construction costs. The former mayor of
   Reykjavik says he believes it is outrageous for the city to give
   Muslims a site at no cost at a great location in the center of the
   city, and asks why political and feminist groups are so tolerant of a
   religion that he says degrades women.

[31]Hamas Threatens Egypt, Israel And Palestinian Authority

   by Khaled Abu Toameh

   If the leaders of Hamas believe that the Egyptians are determined to
   undermine or topple their regime, they will not hesitate to initiate a
   new military confrontation against Israel. Hamas would never dare to
   initiate one against the Egyptian army. It is easier to fire rockets at
   Israel.
