            I too am having trouble getting into my hotmail account. It asked to sign in and won't let me. I tried to reset the pass word and filled out the verification form and still I can not reset my password. When I click on the link to reset it it says microsoft account is temporarily not in service. That's now two days now!!! No one at Microsoft helps you as they say it is a hotmail problem and there is no live support for them even though they are now working with outlook which is a microsoft account. I can access my account only throuh my phone and ipad but not through my laptop. What the hell???!!! All my contacts and all my work is done through hotmail. Please, someone contact me at            <P>

            I had no problem accessing my account this morning and now all of the sudden it claims their are others getting to my address. I followed the recomendations to reinstate my email with no luck. they provide no phone access for help. I will be using another email provider from now on. Microsoft sucks!!            <P>

            I am in a a foreign country and the damn hotmail site is in another language. I cannot access my account or check email. The message I get is to have a code sent to my email account to access it so I can get into my email account. DUH!  Is anyone intelligent in logic working there? <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to email customer service, or even better, change the foreign language computer I am on to English???<br />
<br />
This whole frustrating episode makes me want to quit hotmail, outlook, or whatever else it is called. I hope the hotmail people realize KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid. Not everyone is good with computers. At least have an obvious link to customer service, and how to change the language to English. This whole hotmail thing is a hot mess - this sucks!            <P>

            what is the problem with hotmail? Wants me to change my password, changed to outlook which I do not like, I hate in in fact.<br />
Now it wont let me open it. This is my email. I shouldnt have to fight it to see my own mail.  I shouldnt be told to change my password.  That is my business and no one else business. If I want a 8 letter password with no numbers and no upper case that is my business.  Im finding a different email account which makes it pain in the but to have to tell everyone my new address!!<br />
But I will not be told what to do with my own email!!            <P>

            I have had Hotmail for over 10 years and have never had difficulty with it until it became Outlook.  I used Hotmail just fine on my Smart phone until Outlook took over.  Now, I simply can not access my e-mail from my cell phone and I can not find any help either on-line or via telephone!  I am ready to go to g-mail!!!!  This is so frustratin. I have spent hours trying to get help!            <P>

            Very Very annoyed with the hotmail or outlook, whatever they wanna call themselves. After 11 years my email is hacked into and they want to  to fix an email account that was free and now priceless to me bc it holds a ton of personal information. I am so pissed off that there is no real person on the hotmail/outlook team to contact. freaking loosers.            <P>

            I had a hotmail address for over 10 year. All of a sudden it says the account does not exist. How can I recover this e-mail address. Is this caused by the new microsoft outlook management. Very disappointing.            <P>

            I went to respond to the &quot;member services&quot; email about the &quot;upgrade&quot; to say thanks but no thanks, but it's turned out to be like handling &quot;member services&quot; and related &quot;help desks&quot; at the call center (and insurance company) I used to work for. The inability to contact them, to me, just shows they know their product and service is bad, so they're hiding behind the impenetrable wall of zero convenience contact info and a smile saying &quot;Please enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
No thanks. I'm even telling friends and family how ridiculous this is so they too will leave Hotmail/MSN behind for good.            <P>

            I tried since a few years to stop the subscription of Hotmail. It was registered in Switzerland while I was living there IN 2004. I have moved since and the automatic creditcard billing keeps followig me everwhere, while I never use the service anymore. It is up for renewal once again on 9 May 2013 and i want to stop it but I cannot contact Hotmail. It is a great rip off that even the creditcard company (Visa) cannot avoid. <br />
I WANT TO CANCEL THE HOTMAIL SERVICES ONCE AND FOR ALL, BECAUSE I DONOT USE IT AT ALL SINCE A FEW YEARS NOW. PLEASE HELP ME.            <P>

            My account got hacked, it was an old account and I just want the account frozen or deactivated, but I cannot get in, and I cannot recall the password and looking on the internet all I see is thousands of other people that have also been hacked, yet I cannot find any details to email hotmail, to explain the situation, nothing!<br />
I managed to secure my FB account and email account in a short space of time, but not my hotmail - thanks hotmail you really are incompetent, unsafe and unreliable!            <P>

            This is so stupid ..I have been trying to log in to my hotmail account but couldn't get through the last two weeks..it keep know saying that someone is using my account...how can this happen..they have told me that I typed the wrong password..I Had this hotmail account mire then ten years...and now there's s problem...keep on filling the form but said I have filled it wrong? I ring them two times they answered from  India? And told me there's a fee of $90, 00..what a bull hit they the one who logged our accounts and wants our money<br />
..I said why I need to paid this is not my problem...but they said if I want to delete my account then the fee is $49.00 only delete after I paid this money????? But then they will offer me another free account???  What a ripped off these people.What a shame...they the one who logged us not anyone is trying to use our accounts liars..<br />
I haven't paid anything I just have to ignore them go to the other company...hotmail are useful..they know that we set our accounts more than 10 years so they ripped us because they know that we cannot remember the secret questions and answers that we have been set up in our accounts..<br />

            ... I've lost All my emails from my Father who died in 2011.  I haven't been able to look at them because it has been to painful to re-experience.   Now that I am finally ready to confront the emotions and meaning within them, I log into my Hotmail account, to find they are ALL GONE.  I never gave permission for them to be deleted.  Microsoft and Hotmail should be Disgusted with themselves.  I wish I'd never used their product.            <P>

            Same problem here. My Hotmail was hacked and blocked. I spent endless hours to get an email address for Hotmail support but they simply dont have one! I have tried 100 steps to receiver my account but they were all in vain. <br />
Finally, I called the Sydney 1800 Hotmail support number Only TO be told That i need to pay for the service to unblock my account! I paid $189 Five days ago and guess what, they still can't get my account activated! So, I lost my money and I lost my Hotmail account with some irreplaceable documents and information! I'm so angry with Hotmail. How did they get to where they are today without even having an email support service!!!            <P>

            The same thing happened to me.  You can go in and have your email password changed.  They will send it to however you set up your alternative contact.  I had another email address and my son-in-law helped me. Use another computer to do this.  Do not call a number you find on the web...they are hackers.  I found out the hard way.  Do not allow anyone access to your computer.  There is no free help for a free email.            <P>

            If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!  Newer is not always better!!  I have had my Hotmail account since the inception of Hotmail and I can only remember one other time when Hotmail attempted to change their format...it didn't work then and it doesn't work now.  One example is if you check-mark all the e-mails that you know you want to delete, all at once, with the &quot;clear all checked,&quot; it doesn't work...this was a huge time saver for me before, and time is money!  I also can no longer find on any e-mail that is over a day old the time the e-mail was sent??  This is very important when dealing with legal matters.  And whoever came up with the &quot;...&quot; to find other options such as printing should no longer have a job!!  I have stayed with Hotmail all these years because they weren't always changing things...I may have to re-think that??!!!            <P>
