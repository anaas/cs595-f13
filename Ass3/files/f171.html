        PANDORA&#8217;S BOX?</strong><br>
        <br>
        As troubling as the thoughts in the previous entry are, they could be 
        just the tip of the iceberg as one-on-one interpersonal malevolence by 
        human-animals might quickly be overshadowed by global acts of swarm violence. 
        The possibility of groups of &quot;transhuman terrorists&quot; in the 
        conceivable future is real enough that a House Foreign Affairs committee 
        chaired by California <img src="Images/transmigrationofsouls.gif" width="275" height="162" align="left">Democrat 
        Brad Sherman, best known for his expertise on the spread of nuclear weapons 
        and terrorism, is among a number of government panels and think-tanks 
        currently studying the implications of genetic modification and human-transforming 
        technologies related to future terrorism. CQ Columnist Mark Stencel listened 
        to the recent HFA committee hearings and wrote in his March 15, 2009 article, 
        <em>Futurist: Genes Without Borders</em>, that the conference &quot;sounded 
        more like a Hollywood pitch for a sci-fi thriller than a sober discussion 
        of scientific reality&#8230; with talk of biotech&#8217;s potential for 
        creating supersoldiers, superintelligence and superanimals [that could 
        become] agents of unprecedented lethal force.&quot; </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        <br>
        George Annas, Lori Andrews, and Rosario Isasi were even more apocalyptic 
        in their <em>American Journal of Law and Medicine article, Protecting 
        the Endangered Human: Toward an International Treaty Prohibiting Cloning 
        and Inheritable Alterations</em> when they wrote:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>&quot;The 
          new species, or &#8216;posthuman,&#8217; will likely view the old &#8216;normal&#8217; 
          humans as inferior, even savages, and fit for slavery or slaughter. 
          The normals, on the other hand, may see the posthumans as a threat and 
          if they can, may engage in a preemptive strike by killing the posthumans 
          before they themselves are killed or enslaved by them. It is ultimately 
          this predictable potential for genocide that makes species-altering 
          experiments potential weapons of mass destruction, and makes the unaccountable 
          genetic engineer a potential bioterrorist.&quot;</em> </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Observations 
        like those of Annas, Andrews, and Isasi cause one to wonder if this is 
        not how the servants of Antichrist move with such compassionless brutality 
        in rounding up to destroy all who refuse to receive the Mark of the Beast. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Not to be outpaced in this regard by rogue fringe scientists or even bio-terrorists, 
        DARPA and other agencies of the U.S. military have taken inspiration from 
        the likes of Tolkein&#8217;s Lord of the Rings, and in scenes reminiscent 
        of Saruman the wizard creating monstrous Uruk-Hai to wage unending, merciless 
        war, billions of American tax dollars have flowed into the Pentagon&#8217;s 
        Frankensteinian dream of &quot;super-soldiers&quot; and &quot;Extended 
        Performance War Fighter&quot; programs. Not only does the EPWFP envision 
        &quot;injecting young men and women with hormonal, neurological and genetic 
        concoctions; implanting microchips and electrodes in their bodies to control 
        their internal organs and brain functions; and plying them with drugs 
        that deaden some of their normal human tendencies: the need for sleep, 
        the fear of death, [and] the reluctance to kill their fellow human beings,&quot; 
        but as Chris Floyd in an article for CounterPunch a while back continued, 
        &quot;some of the research now underway involves actually altering the 
        genetic code of soldiers, modifying bits of DNA to fashion a new type 
        of human specimen, one that functions like a machine, killing tirelessly 
        for days and nights on end.... mutations [that] will &#8216;revolutionize 
        the contemporary order of battle&#8217; and guarantee &#8216;operational 
        dominance across the whole range of potential U.S. military employments.&#8217;&quot;

        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In keeping 
        with our study, imagine the staggering implications of such science if 
        dead Nephilim tissue was discovered with intact DNA and a government somewhere 
        was willing to clone or mingle the extracted organisms to make Homo-nephilim. 
        If one accepts the biblical story of Nephilim as real, such discovery 
        could actually be made someday or perhaps already has been and was covered 
        up. As an example of this possibility, in 2009 blood was extracted from 
        the bone of a dinosaur that scientists insist is 80 million years old. 
        Nephilim would have existed in relatively recent times comparably, making 
        clonable material from dead biblical giants feasible. The technology to 
        resurrect the extinct species already exists, and cloning methods are 
        being studied now for use with bringing back Tasmanian Tigers, Wooly Mammoths 
        and other extinguished creatures. National Geographic also confirmed this 
        possibility in their May 2009 special report Recipe for a Resurrection, 
        quoting Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University, an authority on ancient 
        DNA who served as a scientific consultant for the movie Jurassic Park, 
        saying: &quot;I laughed when Steven Spielberg said that cloning extinct 
        animals was inevitable. But I&#8217;m not laughing anymore... This is 
        going to happen. It&#8217;s just a matter of working out the details.&quot; 
        </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Will 
        the same technology lead to the resurrection of the pagan deity Apollo/Osiris/Nimrod, 
        who returns to rule the Novus Order Seclorum? Is material from the deity&#8217;s 
        &#8216;body&#8217; concealed in a tomb at Giza&#8230; or in Washington, 
        DC&#8230; or in the &#8216;sacred casket&#8217; that former U.S. Vice 
        President Henry Wallace mentioned in his letter to Nicholas Roerich, considered 
        in esoteric circles to be the same as the casket or &#8216;coffin&#8217; 
        of Osiris? If so, is it conceivable that plans to revive the Apollonian 
        tissue using biotechnology have already been made, or worse, have already 
        been accomplished and the pagan god waits the moment of its unveiling?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">People 
        not familiar with biblical eschatology may find this idea fantastic, that 
        the being who becomes the Antichrist was once alive, then was dead, and 
        returns from the grave to rule the Novus Ordo Seclorum. But this is exactly 
        what Revelation 17:8 appears to say will happen: &quot;The beast that 
        thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, 
        and go into perdition [Apoleia, Apollo]: and they that dwell on the earth 
        shall wonder&#8230; when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and 
        yet is.&quot; Further, the mythos of the Eye of Horus on the Great Seal, 
        which so fascinated Wallace and company, represents this very concept 
        of deity incarnation into the &quot;King&quot; that is to rule. As mentioned 
        earlier in this blog series, in ancient Egypt where this Great Seal symbol 
        originated, each Pharaoh &quot;became&quot; the incarnation of the falcon 
        god Horus during his lifetime, and at death, the Osiris&#8212;the divine 
        judge of the netherworld.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As biotechnology 
        and synthetic biology advance to the degree that we can now realistically 
        anticipate reviving long-dead species, I have been able to convince a 
        few scholarly minds that the Man of Sin could in fact be the return of 
        a deceased Apollo/Osiris/Nimrod who arrives via biotech resurrection. 
        Even Chuck Missler, though not with the same details, raised the appropriate 
        question not long ago in an online article about the Antichrist: &quot;<a href="http://www.khouse.org/articles/2002/433/" target="_blank">Could 
        it be that this final world dictator will be, in some sense, a return 
        of Nimrod?</a>&quot; In my opinion, this is more than a possibility, and 
        I remember with curiosity how in 1998, Zahi Hawass, the current Secretary 
        General of Egypt&#8217;s Supreme Council of Antiquities, claimed to have 
        found the burial tomb of the god Osiris (Apollo/Nimrod) at the Giza Plateau. 
        In the article Sandpit of Royalty from the newspaper Extra Bladet (Copenhagen), 
        January 31, 1999, Hawass was quoted saying:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>&quot;I 
        have found a shaft, going 29 meters vertically down into the ground, exactly 
        halfway between the Chefren Pyramid and the Sphinx. At the bottom, which 
        was filled with water, we have</em> <img src="Images/osiristomb.gif" width="273" height="171" align="left"><em>found 
        a burial chamber with four pillars. In the middle</em> <em>is a large 
        granite sarcophagus, which I expect to be the grave of Osiris, the god&#8230;I 
        have been digging in Egypt&#8217;s sand for more than 30 years, and up 
        to date this is the most exciting discovery I have made&#8230;. We found</em> 
        <em>the shaft in November and began pumping up the water recently. So 
        several years will pass before we have finished investigating the find.&quot;</em> 
        </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Insofar 
        as we know this discovery did not ultimately provide the physical remains 
        of the deity. Of course, that is, in as far as we know. But what it did 
        illustrate is that at least some very powerful Egyptologists believe Osiris 
        was a historical figure, and that his body was stored somewhere at or 
        near the Great Pyramid. Manly P. Hall, who knew the Masonic legend of 
        Hiram Abiff was a thinly veiled prophecy of the resurrection of Osiris, 
        seems to have understood what Zahi Hawass was looking for, and why. Consider 
        that he wrote in The Secret Teachings of All Ages:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>&quot;The 
          Dying God shall rise again! The secret room in the House of the Hidden 
          Places shall be rediscovered. The Pyramid again shall stand as the ideal 
          emblem of solidarity, inspiration, aspiration, resurrection, and regeneration.</em> 
          </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over 
        the years, biblical scholar Gary Stearman has written extensively about 
        Nimrod (Apollo/Osiris/Gilgamesh) and the connection this historical figure 
        has with Babylonian Mystery Religion, Watchers, Nephilim (including their 
        resurrection), and the spirit of the end-times Antichrist and revival 
        of paganism. He too appears to believe the coming of Antichrist represents 
        a return of Nimrod. &quot;But who is this Assyrian,&quot; he asked in 
        the July 2001 Prophecy in the News Magazine, &quot;He is none other than 
        the spiritual inheritor of the first great post-Flood religious apostasy. 
        He is the keeper of the great heritage that began at the Assyrian capital, 
        Nineveh. Its founder was Nimrod&#8230;. He is the Antichrist, the future 
        despot who comes in the name of the ancient mystery religion.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A year 
        earlier, in June of 2000, Stearman had written in Prophecy in the News 
        concerning Nimrod:</font></p>
      <blockquote>

          religious apostasy. Down through the generations, this system of false 
          worship became known simply as the &quot;Babylonian Mystery Religion.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Its 
          basis is quite clear. <em>It attempts to channel the power of the ancient

        Nimrod. &quot;It was to glorify Nimrod that the whole Chaldean system 
        of iniquity was formed,&quot; he wrote (p.20). Yet Stearman sees that

      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition 
        to the supernatural aspects that biotechnology could provide the Luciferian 
        technology to resurrect Nimrod/Apollo/Osiris in the person of the last 
        days Man of Sin, the ramifications of using the same science to revive 
        extinct animals, Nephilim, or to create newly engineered versions of demigods 
        and mythological animals may also play a role in the Kingdom of Antichrist. 
        This is because as interbreeding begins between transgenic animals, genetically 
        modified humans, and specie as God made them, the altered DNA will quickly 
        migrate into the natural environment, and when that happens (as is already 
        occurring among genetically modified plants and animals), &#8216;alien&#8217; 
        and/or animal characteristics will be introduced to the human gene pool 
        and spread through intermarriage, altering the human genetic code and 
        eventually eliminating humanity as we know it. This is what happened before 
        the Great Flood according to many theologians, and perhaps that has been 
        the whole idea for the end-times as well&#8212;to create a generation 
        of genetically altered &#8216;Nimrods&#8217; to serve as &#8216;fit extensions&#8217; 
        for the resurrection of underworld Nephilim-hordes in preparation of Armageddon.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Does 
        a curious verse in the book of Daniel hint at this? Speaking of the last 
        days of human government, Daniel said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>&quot;&#8230;they 
          shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave 
          one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay&quot;</em> (Dan. 
          2:43).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While 
        Daniel does not explain who they that &quot;mingle themselves with the 
        seed of men&quot; are, the personal pronoun they caused Chuck Missler 
        and Mark Eastman in their book Alien Encounters to ask: &quot;Just what 
        (or who) are &#8216;mingling with the seed of men?&#8217; Who are these 
        Non-seed? It staggers the mind to contemplate the potential significance

        Nephilim, would happen again in the end times. When this verse from Daniel 
        is coupled with Genesis 3:15, which says, &quot;And I will put enmity 
        between thee and the woman, and between thy seed [zera, meaning &quot;offspring,&quot; 
        &quot;descendents,&quot; or &quot;children&quot;] and her seed,&quot;

        antichrist ever since God during the Great Flood halted the practice. 
        According to Louis Pauwells &amp; Jacques Bergier in The Dawn of Magic 
        (first published in France under the title &quot;Le Matin des Magiciens&quot; 
        1960 by Editions Gallimard, Paris), this was certainly the goal of the 
        antichrist Adolf Hitler:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>Hitler&#8217;s 
          aim was neither the founding of a race of supermen, nor the conquest 
          of the world; these were only means towards the realization of the great 
          work he dreamed of. His real aim was to perform an act of creation, 
          a divine operation, the goal of a biological mutation which would result 
          in an unprecedented exaltation of the human race and the &quot;apparition 
          of a new race of heroes and demigods and god-men.&quot;</em> </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One 
          cannot read the conclusion by Pauwells and Bergier regarding Hitler&#8217;s 
          antichrist ambition without seeing how it corresponds perfectly with 
          the Cumaean Sibyl&#8217;s prophecy pertaining to the coming of Apollo, 
          who receives &quot;the life of gods, and sees Heroes with gods commingling.&quot; 
          This calls to mind that from the Middle Ages forward, church leaders 
          have believed the Antichrist would ultimately represent the return of 
          the Nephilim&#8212;the reunion of demons with humans. St. Augustine 
          himself wrote of such demoniality in the City of God </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">, 
          and in the <em>De Daemonialitate, et Incubis, et Succubi</em>, Fr. Ludovicus 
          Maria Sinistrari de Ameno (1622-1701) also perceived the coming of Antichrist 
          as representing the biological hybridization of demons with humans. 
          &quot;To theologians and philosophers,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it is a 
          fact, that from the copulation of humans with the demon&#8230;Antichrist 
          must be born.&quot; </font><font face="Georgia"><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
          <br>
          The English theologian George Hawkins Pember agreed with this premise, 
          and in his 1876 masterpiece Earth&#8217;s Earliest Ages he analyzed 
          the prophecy of Christ that says the end-times would be a repeat of 
          &quot;the days of Noah.&quot; Pember outlined the seven great causes 
          of the antediluvian destruction and documented their developmental beginnings 
          in his lifetime. The seventh and most fearful sign, Pember wrote, would 
          be the return of the Nephilim, &quot;The appearance upon earth of beings 
          from the Principality of the Air, and their unlawful intercourse with 
          the human race.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          Consequently, if the Antichrist is the reincarnation of the demon Apollo 
          as prophesied by the Apostle Paul, not only will he be the exact opposite 
          of Jesus (Son of God), but the forerunner of the return of the Nephilim. 
          The prophet Isaiah (chapters 13 and 14) likewise spoke of the return 
          of these beings, and tied the advent to the destruction of the city 
          of Babylon in the final age. The following verse should give us pause 
          in light of the ongoing presence of US armed forces in Iraq/Babylon 
          and the powder keg surrounding it. From the Septuagint, we read: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>The 
            vision which Esaias son of Amos saw against Babylon. Lift up a standard 
            on the mountain of the plain, exalt the voice to them, beckon with 
            the hand, open the gates, ye ruler. I give command and I bring them: 
            giants are coming to fulfill my wrath&#8230;. For behold! the day 
            of the Lord is coming which cannot be escaped, a day of wrath and 
            anger, to make the world desolate&#8230;. And Babylon&#8230;shall 
            be as when God overthrew Sodoma and Gomorrah&#8230;. It shall never 
            be inhabited&#8230;and monsters shall rest there, and devils shall 
            dance there and satyrs shall dwell there . . .</em> (Isaiah 13:1-3, 
            9, 19-22). </font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One 
        can only speculate if something more than is casually perceived is meant 
        by Isaiah when he says, &quot;<em>open the gates, ye ruler</em>,&quot; 
        but whoever this ruler is, he opens &#8216;gates&#8217; in Iraq/Babylon 
        through which end-times giants (Gibborim) return to the surface of earth 
        as agents of God&#8217;s wrath. Noting that Isaiah ties the destruction 
        of Iraq/Babylon with the reappearance of Gibborim in this way, we recall 
        how thousands of US troops on invading Iraq during the Bush administration 
        admittedly filled U.S. containers with archaeological materials, including 
        what some have speculated to be cuneiform tablets pointing to the location 
        of pure-blooded Nephilim buried in underground caves. This is exactly 
        where Enoch said the antediluvian Nephilim are, and raises fascinating 
        questions: Would agencies like DARPA have interest in studying or cloning 
        the extinct beings if they were, or have been, found? Could man in his 
        arrogance revive ancient DNA, revitalizing or blending it with other living 
        organisms in a way similar to what the Watchers did in making the first 
        Nephilim? Is this how the Rephaim (dead Nephilim) who are viewed as squirming 
        beneath the surface of the earth, rise to challenge the armies of God 
        during Armageddon? Is the factual reappearance on earth of legendary beings 
        verified by Isaiah, who foresaw creatures such as satyrs (transgenic half-man 
        half-goats) accompanying the return of giants in the end-times, or why 
        other Apocryphal Books like 2 Esdras 5:8 prophesy the birth of &quot;monsters&quot; 
        for the same period of time? Some may be shocked to learn that in addition 
        to the citations above, the Bible actually describes an end-times confrontation 
        between the &#8216;mythological gods&#8217; and Christ. &quot;The Lord 
        will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth&quot; 
        says Zephaniah 2:11. &quot;The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; 
        Behold, I will punish the&#8230; gods&quot; (Jer. 46:25). Human followers 
        of the pagan deities will also join the conflict, calling upon their &quot;idols 
        of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood&quot; (Rev. 9:20) 
        to convene their powers against the Christian God, uniting with &quot;unclean 
        spirits like frogs&#8230; the spirits of devils working miracles, which 
        go forth unto the kings of the earth&#8230; to gather them to the battle 
        of that great day&#8230; [to] a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon 
        [Megiddo]&quot; (Rev. 16:13-14;16).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Given 
        that the prophets foretold a day when mythical characters and &quot;gods&quot; 
        would return to earth to conduct war against the God of the Bible, it 
        is more than a little disturbing that man has, for the first time since 
        before the Great Flood, intentionally set course to repeat what ancient 
        records say the Watchers did. The accelerated pace by scientific exploration 
        against God&#8217;s Divine Order, and the subsequent revival of Watcher 
        technology leading to transhuman or revived forms of Nephilim, has without 
        doubt pushed the end-times clock closer to midnight than most comprehend.</font></p>

        70 GENERATIONS: IS THAT THE GROUND I FEEL RUMBLING?</strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Enoch 
        was the son of Jared, father of Methuselah and great-grandfather of Noah 
        whose writings provide the most detailed account of the fall of the &quot;Watchers,&quot; 
        the angels who fathered <img src="Images/enoch-b.gif" width="279" height="199" align="right">the 
        infamous Nephilim. While the book of Enoch is no longer included in most 
        versions of the Bible, Enoch&#8217;s writings are quoted in the New Testament 
        in at least two places, and he is mentioned by name in both the Old and 
        New Testaments, including Jude 14-15 where one of his prophecies is cited. 
        During the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, pre-Maccabean fragments 
        of the Book of Enoch were found, helping scholars to verify the book&#8217;s 
        antiquity while also illustrating that the ancients held these texts to 
        be inspired. Many early Church Fathers likewise considered the Book of 
        Enoch to be sacred, including Tertullian, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen 
        and Clement of Alexandria. This is an important fact because if Enoch 
        was truly a prophet, then the world may be in for an unfathomable surprise 
        concerning the return of Nephilim, and soon.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 
        tenth chapter of the book of Enoch, it says the Watchers who were judged 
        during the flood would be bound beneath the hills of the earth for 70 
        generations, until the day of their final judgment when they will be released 
        from those confines and thrown into an abyss of fire, &quot;to the torment 
        and the prison in which they shall be confined for ever.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But 
        in the fifteenth chapter, Enoch writes about the deceased offspring of 
        the Watchers, the giants or Nephilim, and describes them as being released 
        at the same time to bring slaughter and destruction upon man:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>&quot;The 
          spirits of the giants&#8230;shall be concealed, and shall not rise up 
          against the sons of men, and against women; until they come forth during 
          the days of slaughter and destruction&quot;</em> (Enoch 15:9-10).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
        particular prophecy mirrors those of Isaiah and other apocryphal works, 
        which indicate a future date in which Watchers will rise for judgment 
        while their giant offspring resurrect &quot;from beneath the hills of 
        the earth&quot; to wreak havoc upon earth. According to Enoch, this unparalleled 
        event is scheduled to occur after 70 generations have passed from the 
        time of the Flood.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
        could be troubling.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although 
        traditional scholarship places the time of the Great Flood between BC 
        2500 and 2300, modern dating by some researchers has roughly estimated 
        the flood to have actually transpired between BC 2800 and 2900. For instance 
        this is the dating given by a group of scientists from the USA, Russia, 
        Australia, France, and Ireland known as the Holocene Impact Working Group 
        who hypothesize the Great Flood resulted from a comet striking the Indian 
        Ocean between 2800-2900 BC, resulting in a mega-tsunami. Because a prophetic 
        generation is 70 years based on Psalm 90:10 (&quot;The days of our years 
        are threescore years and ten&quot;), Enoch&#8217;s 70 generations times 
        70 years equals exactly 4900 years forward from the flood. If the flood 
        took place between BC 2800 and 2900, this brings the return of the Nephilim 
        to the immediate hour. In other words, if this BC 2800 to 2900 dating 
        is correct, mankind is on the threshold of Watchers being raised from 
        their underground prisons and thrown into an abyss of fire, while their 
        giant offspring return to the surface of earth in violent fulfillment 
        of multiple prophecies (and does this coincide with the Mayan 2012 return 
        of Quatzlecoatl?)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have 
        no idea whether the modern time frame for the Great Flood is reasonable, 
        but the Book of Jubilees&#8212;another apocryphal text&#8212;seems to 
        verify this frightening scenario, prophesying Nephilim on earth in the 
        last days. Again, the familiar word &quot;corruption&quot; turns up in 
        association with these beings, insinuating an end-times repeat of what 
        the Watchers did by corrupting human DNA and blending it with animals 
        to retrofit human bodies for Nephilim incarnation. Note that this happens 
        just before Satan is judged.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>&quot;The 
          malignant evil ones [spirits of Nephilim destroyed in the flood] were 
          bound in the place of condemnation, but a tenth part of them were left 
          that they might be subject before Satan on the earth. These are for 
          corruption [corruption of DNA as in days of old?] and leading astray 
          men before Satan&#8217;s judgment&quot;</em> (10:7-12).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Finally, 
        a prophecy in the second chapter of the Book of Joel could refer to the 
        same end-times volcano of resurrected Nephilim. While some expositors 
        say Joel was most likely describing an army of locusts, with phrases like 
        &quot;[They are] a great people and a strong&quot; and &quot;they shall 
        run like mighty men [Gibborim]&quot; it is reasonable to question if in 
        fact these verses are talking about grasshoppers.</font></p>
