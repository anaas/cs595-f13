   Iran's foreign minister will meet six major world powers at the UN this
   week to discuss Tehran's nuclear programme, US and EU officials say.

   The talks with Iranian FM Mohammed Javad Zarif will include US
   Secretary of State John Kerry - the highest level US-Iran meeting for
   more than 30 years.

   Talks will take place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in
   New York.

   Iran's new President Hassan Rouhani has said he is ready to restart
   stalled nuclear talks without preconditions.

Analysis

     __________________________________________________________________

   The meeting between John Kerry and Mohammed Zarif will be the highest
   level face-to-face contact between the Americans and the Iranians since
   the 1979 Islamic Revolution. This in itself is a sign of the potential
   significance of the opening signalled by the new Iranian President
   Hassan Rouhani, whose charm offensive towards the West will be tested
   out by the ministers meeting in the margins of the UN General Assembly.

   They clearly want to see an Iranian willingness to make concessions on
   its nuclear programme if there is to be any lifting or lightening of
   sanctions.

   But Iran too comes to this meeting with concerns. It wants a clear
   indication that the US is willing to treat Iran with the respect it
   believes it deserves as a significant regional player. Indeed it is
   only the US that can really address some of Iran's fundamental
   strategic concerns and that too makes this meeting so interesting.

   In a separate development, Tehran said it had pardoned 80 prisoners.

   Among them are a number of those who were arrested over protests
   following the disputed presidential election in 2009.

   The move comes a few days after a pardon was issued to 11 inmates.
   'Charm offensive'

   EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Mr Zarif, who is also
   Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, would this week meet foreign ministers
   from the five permanent UN Security Council members - Britain, China,
   France, Russia and the US - and also Germany (the P5+1 group).

   "We had a good and constructive discussion," Baroness Ashton said after
   her talks with Mr Zarif at the UN on Monday.

   She said she had been struck by the "energy and determination" that she
   had seen from the Iranians ahead of this week's UN General Assembly.

   And the EU official added that her team would hold talks with Mr Zarif
   again in October in Geneva to assess the progress.

   A US State Department official quoted by AFP news agency cautioned that
   "no-one should have the expectation that we're going to resolve this
   decades-long issue during the P5+1 meeting later this week".

Historic US-Iran meetings

     * Direct contact between Mr Obama and Mr Rouhani would be first
       between US and Iranian leaders for 36 years
     * Jimmy Carter and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi were last US-Iranian
       leaders to meet, in 1977
     * US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Iranian Foreign Minister
       Manouchehr Mottaki exchanged "hellos" at Sharm el-Sheikh in 2007
       but did not hold talks

   The official said the "ball was firmly in Iran's court".

   The meetings at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly are part of a
   charm offensive by Mr Rouhani, the BBC's Bridget Kendall in New York
   reports.

   In 2007, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was supposed to be
   seated next to then-Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki at a summit
   dinner in Egypt, but Mr Mottaki stayed away from the dinner.

   Last week, Mr Rouhani said that his country would never build nuclear
   weapons.

   In an interview with the US broadcaster NBC, the president stressed
   that he had full authority to negotiate with the West over Tehran's
   uranium enrichment programme.

   And he described a recent letter sent to him by US President Barack
   Obama as "positive and constructive".
   Hassan Rouhani. 10 Sept 2013 President Hassan Rouhani has promised to
   introduce reforms

   A White House spokesman said Mr Obama's letter "indicated that the US
   is ready to resolve the nuclear issue in a way that allows Iran to
   demonstrate that its nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful
   purposes".

   "The letter also conveyed the need to act with a sense of urgency to
   address this issue because, as we have long said, the window of
   opportunity for resolving this diplomatically is open, but it will not
   remain open indefinitely," the spokesman added.

   The latest moves come amid suggestions that Mr Obama and Mr Rouhani may
   meet on the sidelines of the General Assembly and shake hands.

   In his election campaign earlier this year, Mr Rouhani pledged a more
   moderate and open approach in international affairs.

   Iran is under UN and Western sanctions over its controversial nuclear
   programme.

   Tehran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes but the US
   and its allies suspect Iran's leaders of trying to build a nuclear
   weapon.
