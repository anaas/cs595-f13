His mother Sora Takenouchi and father Yamato Takenouchi both were killed by a notorious rich punk who simply killed them only because they were not born with a paradise like face and were ugly. The rich punk however got away with it, talking of money power everyone simply gives up, no matter how serious the crime is. Talking of parents, Kenta was also bestowed with a poor deformed face however his sister was an exception as she was born with a princess like beauty. Kenta loved his sister very much and so did Mitsuki. The childhood life of Kenta and Mitsuki was happy and prosperous as their grandparents took proper care of them especially Kenta who was home schooled by his own grandparents as they were afraid that Kenta's looks might have a similar fate that their son and daughter-in-law had to suffer. Scared of such feelings Kenta's grandparents never used to allow him to go outside however Mitsuki being different from Kenta enjoyed the outside world. As time passed Mitsuki and Kenta celebrated their coming of age ceremony and now it was time for them to pursue a college degree.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24147077" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24147077">				<div id="img_url_8377201" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

Both Mitsuki and Kenta decided to visit the nearby city to pursue their further education; however their grandparents were reluctant for Kenta. Melanco wanted to show his brother the outside world, so she argued with her grandparents to allow him to come with her. Seeing his sister throwing tantrums for him, Kenta too got carried away with limelight of visiting the outside world. Seeing Kenta too joining the discussions, their grandparents were helpless as Mitsuki and Kenta were no longer kids. Grandparents continued to hold their ground but the result wasn't a stay but instead both Kenta and Mitsuki left Melanco against their grandparent’s wishes. This is where all the story of ordeal starts as the path ahead is tough and meanly.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24147078" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24147078">				<div id="img_url_8377263" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

Kenta was astonished as to why his grandparents were so worried about him as the world outside is so beautiful and what possibly can go wrong in here. Kenta and Mitsuki took an evening bus to the nearby city. Everything was going smoothly as planned but somewhere in Mitsuki's heart there was a fear that the outside world would not accept his ugly brother's looks. She was all numb when suddenly passengers started pouring into the bus from the next bus depot. Talking of human nature gossiping is something every human longs for, besides a bit of ugliness adds to this cruel nature wherein words can be sometimes so agonizing that forces one to simply offer themselves to the Shinigami's. Seeing Kenta and his sister sitting together, people started gossiping about Kenta's looks. Kenta although he heard the murmuring of the passengers, he avoided it as he wasn't used to such low sounds and continued to enjoy the beautiful world outside through the Bus window. </p></div></div><div id="mod_24147551" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24147551">				<div id="img_url_8377296" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

The college took admissions based on the admission tests conducted by the college. They both passed the admission tests successfully and got scholarships as well. During the test Kenta saw a boy named Zen Yagami who, was sitting beside him. During the test Zen copied Kenta's answers without his knowledge. Zen was a hopeless case but due to copying from Kenta, he secured an amazing and unexpected result. Zen was excited to meet Kenta again and wanted to make him his sidekick so that he can secure good results by sitting beside Kenta. College reopening had a weeks’ time so Mitsuki and Kenta decided to utilize the time in touring the city so that they know the city well where they are going to live in. Both Kenta and Mitsuki started their tour but once again they were accompanied by murmurings about Kenta's look. Kenta was disheartened and sad, but thanks to his sister's cheering they somehow completed the journey in utter awkwardness. While Mitsuki had trouble bearing the murmurings on the other hand for Kenta everything was for first time and thus his mental stability was quickly deteriorating.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24150118" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24150118">				<div id="img_url_8377987" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

Kenta went to the college along with his sister; Kenta was still upset over his looks as he was aware that people don't like him. His only support was his sister which somewhat build the confidence in him to face the world. As Kenta entered into his class the murmurings got louder and he was again surrounded with clouds of sadness. Suddenly a huge figure stood before him, scared Kenta was now sure that he is going to be beaten now but to his surprise the huge figure hugged him. The huge figure was none other than Zen himself.

They both became great friends and would spend most of the time together. Seeing this Mitsuki was relieved as now there was someone near his brother who understands him. Mitsuki abandoned her duty of looking over his brother all the time as he now had the company of Zen. Mitsuki soon was accompanied with lots of work and she hardly had any time to talk to his brother, besides she got a boyfriend too.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24147079" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24147079">				<div id="img_url_8377995" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

One fine day a girl was murmuring bad about Kenta's looks to Zen and he was nodding his head in order to impress the girl but unknowingly he grew a bit of hatred for Kenta and soon all the gossips made him think that Kenta was lowering his reputation among girls. A few days later a beautiful girl was talking to Zen, when suddenly Kenta came and sat near them. The girl horrified by Kenta's looks ran away from there. Seeing this Zen was annoyed and spoke badly with Kenta and broke his friendship with him. Kenta was devastated as his bond that he cherished the most was broken because of his looks. Kenta engulfed himself in clouds of sadness as if Shinigami playing games with him. Since Mitsuki was overwhelmed with her work, she could hardly get time to comfort his brother. Although she would work day and night but she was always thinking about his brother. She feared that Kenta's broken heart might eat him from inside and finally Kenta might lose himself. Days passed on, Kenta had stopped going to college, he would spent his most of the time sitting and crying in a dark room. Kenta's health soon started deteriorating, seeing this Mitsuki took a week’s leave from her college, although she couldn't get leave from her part time job due to holiday rush. Seeing her schedule she thought of requesting her grandparents to visit their place. She went to Melanco in the morning next day and brought the worrying grandparents along with her.

God's are mysterious and do things which are tormenting but they are for once good only, as they finally get to learn of their existence, their importance and a precious lesson that life is full of tests and one needs to be always prepared to face them no matter what because in the ending your fruits of hard work or struggle will be served.

Said the Angel who was watching Kenta's dream, but the wish Kenta longed for was a forbidden wish as humans are born to achieve great things in their life irrespective of their cast, looks, sex or environment they are in because as the Angel mentioned that all things that happen in the world are difficulties to teach you the truth behind the test and they are there only to help individuals achieve greatness by following the right path.

After a while he saw farm owners coming to work so he decided to head back to his home. While coming back he was quite happy and almost forgot about his torment. Meanwhile his grandfather was going to his work and unknowingly Kenta responded with a Good morning cheer but to a surprise his grandfather didn’t respond to it and went to his work without even turning back to smile. But actually Kenta was the one who asked for it! Yes the forbidden wish was in action which turned Kenta invisible to the outside world. Since Kenta was unaware of the granted forbidden wish, he took the incident as a consequence of his looks. Since he already was tormented with his looks the incident of getting ignored by family whom he was the most closest to had now intensified his pain by several tons. Since Kenta was now invisible to everyone, he suffered the same consequence of getting ignored by his grandmother and sister as he had with his grandfather.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24150189" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24150189">				<div id="img_url_8378336" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

While Invisibility can be a power but being forbidden, if the granter continues to stay in this state, their soul will be devoured inch by inch and if granter is unable to break the invisibility then his soul will turn into a hollow. The spell to break the invisibility power lies within the user’s conscious morals and the moment user realizes the truth behind the circle of life, they will get freed from the cause behind their forbidden invisibility wish and the hell chains will disappear sucking all the dark from the user’s soul, leaving the user a gift and a purpose"</em></p>

Due to the increasing torment of being ignored for his looks, the forbidden chains of hell drew closer to his heart. If the forbidden chains reach the soul chain then it would destroy the connection of heart to the soul and in turn Kenta into a hollow, but if somehow Kenta has a sudden moral uplift and an strong urge to live his life and show himself to the outside world then the chains of hell will be destroyed and in turn a new kenta will be born with an unknown gift with a gifted purpose. No one knows what the purpose would be because the wish is forbidden and also the granter of the wish are left unaware of the granted wish because the wish itself determines that it can't be misused by the granter.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24150191" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24150191">				<div id="img_url_8384852" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

Since Kenta was invisible and also being unaware that he's invisible, he was assuming that people are ignoring him for his looks. Also since he had a similar encounter with his grandparents and his sister, he never returned home after the incident where his grandparents and sister were desperately trying to search for him. If Kenta was aware about it then he might have broken the forbidden wish long ago but unfortunately his circumstances were just ironic and tormenting. He continued to drift with his sufferings. One day he was walking sad on the road when he suddenly was mesmerized by a beautiful girl travelling in her bike. Kenta immediately fell in love with the girl but once again the cloaks of invisibility fell upon him. The girl went straight without even giving a bit of glimpse on Kenta. Kenta once again followed by his thoughts about his looks intensified his pain bringing the forbidden chains almost close to cutting his soul chain but suddenly a small spark of love grew within him which made him think that if I can't be with her, I can at least see her. Immediately he ran behind trail left behind by the girls bike in hope of seeing her again and also to know about her whereabouts.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24179815" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24179815">				<div id="img_url_8384982" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

He saw his sister sitting sad in the balcony, He calls for Mitsuki and she responds too, but Kenta being invisible she's unable to see him although Kenta was standing just before her. This makes Kenta realize about his invisibility. Shocked by the fact the forbidden chains almost reach the soul chain and starts to rub against them when suddenly the girl from before appears before Kenta. Delighted by this he runs to follow her as he was now aware that he's invisible and no one probably will notice him. For the first time ever since the granted forbidden wish Kenta was happy. Kenta followed her and now knew her name as Magumi who was studying in same college as to where Kenta used to study and in fact she was in same year as Kenta but in different section. He would daily follow her from his house to her college. He wished to show himself to her but whenever he would think of that a counter feeling about his looks would put him down.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24179816" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24179816">				<div id="img_url_8384984" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">

Since everything happened so fast that kenta didn't realize that his appearance is no longer the same, overwhelmed by the flowing emotions he fell down on the ground and thanked God for reliving him from his torment. Kenta was now incredibly surprised on seeing Magumi along with his best friend Zen. Also to a surprise it was now snowing and not raining as if the angels have been celebrating his revival. Seeing Kenta kneeling Zen thought he's proposing to his sister Magumi and was happy for he knew about it and was aware that Ken was a bit shy and lacked confidence to propose his sister. Not to confuse Kenta's horrible past has been changed into Ken's beautiful past wherein people love Ken and his best friend Zen are still together. Seeing Ken's charm Magumi too fell in love with Ken (Kenta). Overwhelmed by so much happiness Ken hugged both Magumi and Zen tightly and started crying she was no longer burdened by his bad looks.</p></div></div><div id="mod_24179185" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_24179185">				<div id="img_url_8384978" class="inline_hub_image fullWidth">
