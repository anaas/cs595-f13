   There has been a worried response in Greece to the win for German
   Chancellor Angela Merkel in Sunday's election.

   The front page of the centre-left daily Ta Nea has a mocked-up photo of
   Angela Merkel on a throne with the headline "Triumph for the Queen of
   Austerity".

   Mrs Merkel is seen as the figure behind austerity measures imposed on
   Greece after its 2010 bailout.

   Reaction on the financial markets has been restrained as investors wait
   to see what sort of coalition emerges.

Analysis

     __________________________________________________________________

   The most intense pressure in the eurozone financial crisis may have
   eased, but there is a still a heavy agenda to work through.

   There is certainly a perception that some of it has been on hold until
   after the German election.

   There's a real chance that further bailouts will be needed - a second
   for Portugal and a third for Greece. So far the financial assistance
   has come in the form of loans, but Greece in particular could need debt
   relief.

   There is also the eurozone's banking union project. One element is a
   central authority for dealing with struggling banks.

   The plan is for the banks themselves to finance it, but in the early
   stages it could need taxpayers' money. None of this will be popular in
   Germany, but it is perhaps the price of underpinning the eurozone.

   Greeks blame austerity measures for an unemployment rate that has risen
   to almost 28%.

   "There is little joy here at the prospect of another four years of Mrs
   Merkel," says BBC Athens correspondent Mark Lowen.

   "She's come to symbolise the much-hated budget cuts demanded of
   Greece".

   Greece needs an extra 10bn euros of funding from its creditors next
   year and now the German election is over those talks can begin.

   The Greek government says the country cannot take any more austerity
   and needs debt relief by lowering interest rates or extending the
   repayment period of its loans.

   Some Greeks hope that Chancellor Merkel will invite Peer Steinbrueck of
   the Social Democrats (SPD) into a coalition.

   He has criticised austerity and called for more growth measures to help
   this debt-stricken economy.

   But Mark Lowen says: "It's unlikely that there'll be any significant
   change of policy from Berlin, particularly as Chancellor Merkel's
   handling of the euro crisis proved so popular with her voters."

   Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party took about 42% of the
   vote, but finished just short of an absolute majority, official results
   show.

   But she might yet have to seek a grand coalition with the Social
   Democrats (SPD) who won about 26% of the vote.

   "The result of Germany's election is, first and foremost, a big vote of
   confidence in Merkel and her handling of the eurozone crisis," said
   Nicholas Spiro, who runs his own research firm, Spiro Strategy.

   "No other leader of a major economy has been able to reap more
   political dividends from an international financial and economic
   crisis."
   Other business

   As well as Greece, Chancellor Merkel's victory could also allow Europe
   to make progress on other pressing issues.

   Portugal's financial situation remains precarious and the government is
   pushing for the target on its government finances to be eased.

   Last week, credit rating agency S&P said there was an increased
   likelihood that Portugal might need another bailout.

   Progress on the eurozone's banking union project has also been
   disrupted.

   The project has been designed to make the financial sector more
   resistant to future crises and involves the creation of a central
   agency to deal with failed banks.

   The agency will need some financial backing in its early years, but
   Germany has so far been reluctant to provide that support.

   "The most intense pressure in the eurozone financial crisis may have
   eased, but there is a still a heavy agenda to work through," said BBC
   Economics Correspondent, Andrew Walker.

   "None of this will be popular in Germany, but it is perhaps the price
   of underpinning the eurozone," he said.
   'Cautiously optimistic'

   Market reaction to Mrs Merkel's victory has been muted, as investors
   wait to see what kind of coalition emerges after the election.

   "It will be tough to buy the euro strongly on the German elections as
   it will be some time before we know what kind of coalition we will
   get," said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank in
   Frankfurt.

   "Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, dependent on data.

   "A coalition with the SPD should result in euro-friendly and peripheral
   [nation] friendly policies," she said.

   Germany's economy has been leading Europe out of recession, and during
   the April to June quarter it grew by 0.7%.
