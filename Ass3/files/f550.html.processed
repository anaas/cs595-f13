Obama's 'independent' NSA review board staffed with administration insiders

   President Barack Obama said in August that an independent panel will
   review the United Statesâ surveillance capabilities in the wake of
   damaging NSA leaks. One month later, though, that groupâs game plan is
   being called into question.

   A steady stream of disclosures credited to former intelligence
   contractor Edward Snowden have revealed since June previously
   unreported details about the National Security Agency and the vast
   surveillance apparatus operated by the US government. Reports of those
   leaks in the media have made lawmakers on both sides of the aisle
   question the nationâs intelligence gathering operations in the months
   since, and politicians and the public alike have asked for reform as a
   result of Snowdenâs disclosures.

   Among the most significant results â seemingly, at least â came in
   early August when Pres. [33]Obama said he was tasking an âindependent
   group to step back and review our capabilities â particularly our
   surveillance technologies.â

   The agency would consider for the White House ways the administration
   can âmaintain the trust of the people,â âmake sure that there
   absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies
   are usedâ and âask how surveillance impacts our foreign policy,
   particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming
   public,â the president said.

   However, Stephen Braun wrote for the Associated Press over the weekend
   that the review board established after that Aug. 9 address is raising
   almost as many questions as the NSA operations they were put together
   to investigate.

   âBut with just weeks remaining before its first deadline to report back
   to the White House, the review panel has effectively been operating as
   an arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which
   oversees the NSA and all other US spy efforts,â Braun wrote.

   This, of course, after the president went on the record to establish a
   so-called independent review board, only to in turn place DNI James
   Clapper at its forefront.

   Following initial reports that Clapper would guide the panel â aptly
   named the Director of National Intelligence Review Group on
   Intelligence and Communications Technologies â the White House was
   quick to condemn those write-ups as [34]incorrect.

   âThe panel will not report to the DNI. As the DNI's statement yesterday
   made clear, the review group will brief its interim findings to the
   president within 60 days of its establishment, and provide a final
   report with recommendations no later than December 15 2013,â national
   security council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told the Guardian last
   month.

   "As we announced on Friday, the review group will be made up of
   independent, outside experts. The DNI's role is one of facilitation,
   and the group is not under the direction of or led by the DNI,â Hayden
   said.

   According to Braun though, the group isnât exactly all that
   independent. From the AP:

   âThe panel's advisers work in offices on loan from the DNI. Interview
   requests and press statements from the review panel are carefully
   coordinated through the DNI's press office. James Clapper, the
   intelligence director, exempted the panel from U.S. rules that require
   federal committees to conduct their business and their meetings in ways
   the public can observe. Its final report, when it's issued, will be
   submitted for White House approval before the public can read it.â

   And as for those independent experts? Braun identified four of its five
   members as previous staffers in Democratic administrations, including a
   former Central Intelligence Agency Director and an ex-regulatory czar
   who served within the Obama White House. Another member, the University
   of Chicagoâs Geoffrey Stone, wrote an op-ed in Huffington Post earlier
   this year defending the NSAs practices exposed by Snowden and the
   credibility of court established under the Foreign Intelligence
   Surveillance Act to oversee those operations.

   âIt is important to note, though, that without the existence of a FISA
   court to which Executive Branch officials are answerable, there is
   little doubt that the NSA and the FBI would be authorizing all sorts of
   investigations that would not meet the standards now imposed by the
   FISA court,â Stone wrote. âIn that sense, the existence of the FISA
   court plays a critical role.â

   Before that, Braun wrote, Stone was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008
   presidential campaign.

   "No one can look at this group and say it's completely independent,"
   Sascha Meinrath, director of the Open Technology Institute, told Braun.

   Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian writer who first reported on the Snowden
   leaks, said on Monday that the panel was âa total farce.â And when Tech
   Dirtâs Mike Masnick wrote about Obamaâs Aug. 9 presser, he said, âAll
   in all this seems like a PR scramble by the an administration that
   realizes it's on the losing side of the public debate.â Weighing in on
   the latest news from the AP, Masnick updated his opinion of the panel
   on Monday to describe it now as âa propaganda committee effectively
   overseen by James Clapper to talk up how awesome the surveillance state
   has become.â

   The review groupâs interim findings will be sent to the president in
   early October. After the White House reviews them, a final report with
   recommendations is due to the administration no later than ten days
   before Christmas.

   I am only trying to help because I see the blind admiration many people
   on this site have for Putin when he has rolled back many freedoms and
   civil liberties in Russia.
   It is no matter though it is hard to believe an anonomous poster on the
   internet when you have been led to believe differently for most of your
   life. Perhaps you have have the opportunity to put a face to my words
   when my work in Russia begins.

   I am well aware of the corporate influence in US politics which is why
   I am fighting for split- funded funded elections in which a capped
   amount can be raised by private funders.
   An d you are free to speak as you wish as I have no power to stop you
   and even if you did I would not wish to you. I am saying your opinion
   has no validity with me unless you provide evidence.
   Y ou act like this is some sort of battle, when I am a friend to the
   Russian people and the people of every country for that matter.

   And don't ask me to provide you with evidence as if this is some kind
   of a legal dispute, I'm expressing an opinion.
   It's called freedom of speech, if you're a citizen of the US, I don't
   expect you to understand.
