Time Management Tips - Reduce Regrets Using 3 Strategic Risks To Maximize
Effectiveness

   By [17]Paula Eder
   [18]Expert Author Paula Eder

   Time management tips that attempt to avoid all risk carry one
   guarantee; they will waste your time. On the other hand, strategic
   risks foster vitality and growth in countless areas of your life. But
   exactly how do you risk wisely? Well, the following 3 guidelines will
   help you discover what challenges to embrace to make the most of your
   time.

   1) Dare to create dynamic goals.

     "Life begins at the end of your comfort zone."

     Neals Donald Walsch

   Unswerving loyalty to an old goal may provide the illusion of
   stability. But goals can trip you up unless you periodically review
   them to see if they remain a good fit for you.

   Perhaps your work skills have evolved considerably and have not been
   rewarded. You might be settling for a job that no longer challenges
   you. Be alert to telltale signs such as boredom and resentment.
   Consider asking yourself each evening, "What lessons do I learn from my
   day? How does what I now understand inform my goals from here on?"

   Create goals that present a genuine stretch. Envision how these goals
   will bring out the very best in you. And validate each way you evolve
   in response to your experience today. What feeds your confidence feeds
   your dreams.

   2) Risk from your heart.

     "Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder,
     spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human
     spirit."

     e. e. cummings

   For the greatest gains, invest your most valued currency - yourself!
   Unless you engage fully, you merely minimize losses and bypass
   significant lessons. To grow, learn. To learn, care.

   Congruent Choices + Self Loyalty = Power and Inner Balance

   Identify one doable risk to make your day more fulfilling. Perhaps you
   need to say no to an activity you once shared with others. That can
   feel like going out on a limb!

   When risking from the heart, look to yourself.

   This deepens self-reference. And you stop perpetuating the illusion of
   controlling others. Illusions, of course, always let you down and waste
   your time.

   3) Create balance through momentum.

     "And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more
     painful than the risk it took to blossom."

     Anais Nin

   Do you tend to freeze under pressure? Self-doubt can be paralyzing.
   When you are tempted to hunker down rather than grow to meet changing
   circumstances, think of balance when bicycling. You need a certain
   level of speed to keep from wobbling and then toppling!

   Dynamic growth, you see, stabilizes you because you remain engaged. To
   fully participate in your life, perhaps you need to broaden your base
   and include more variety to your time choices.

   One way to assess your range of pastimes is to explore which basic
   needs they satisfy in you. For example, in what percentage of
   activities do you:

   * Acquire?

   * Give to others?

   * Foster personal growth?

   Are your time commitments lopsided to favor only one or two of the
   above categories?

   Also, do your 'give-get-grow' time choices share a theme like embracing
   challenge or building community? What do common themes tell you about
   yourself and your values? How do they affect your stability as you
   transition from one set of activities to the next?

   There's safety in spunk.

     "Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It's courage that
     counts."

     Sir Winston Churchill

   Some outer-directed risks like gambling threaten your safety and your
   welfare. But extending yourself by using these tips is more than safe -
   it's life-giving! Investing time to build capacity reflects your
   dedication to grow and thrive. So long as you commit to learning each
   lesson and dealing with all consequences, you know you will enhance
   your life by expanding your understanding. Strategic risking is the
   most profound investment you'll make to honor the time you spend every
   day of your life.

   So how will you use this wisdom today?
