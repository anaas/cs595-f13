Siberian Husky Training

   Siberian husky training is a special topic to write about. Many people
   are interested in how Siberian huskies train, what they learn, and how
   to have a successful sled dog. There is a very special way to begin
   training Siberian huskies. In order for the dogs in dog sled races to
   become racing dogs, they have to go through very extensive training.

   Siberian husky training requires, first and foremost, basic knowledge
   about how to train dogs and how to become a dog trainer. Begin with
   basic dog obedience training, and consider enrolling your dog in dog
   obedience training schools or classes. Siberian Huskies require the
   same basic control as any other breed, but it is even more important to
   start with a good foundation when training a sled dog or racing dog.

Siberian Husky Training: What do they learn?

   In Siberian husky training, the following are some examples of the
   commands you must teach your dog in order to enter races and have your
   dogs pull a sled:

   - “Woah” (a term to teach your sled dogs to slow down)
   - “Hut” (a term to teach your dog to speed up)

   It is critical that your dog understands these, and many other
   commands, when racing, especially as a sled dog. Siberian husky
   training is very difficult and requires a lot of time, practice, and
   effort. In a sport that is raced in such dangerous conditions of snow
   and ice, complete control is necessary for your safety.

Siberian Husky Training: How do they learn it?

   There are many possible ways of training sled dogs, and I am by no
   means an expert. However, there are basic dog training tips you can
   follow to begin the process of having successful racing dogs. An
   important place to start is by presenting yourself as an alpha male.

   Stepping into the role of the alpha male involves following these basic
   dog training ideas:

   - Walk into a room before your dog does.
   - Eat before your dog does.
   - Never go to your dog, make him come to you.
   - When you go home, don’t acknowledge your dog before she acknowledges
   you.

   Remember, in order for Siberian Huskies, or any dog, to work under your
   command, you have to be the alpha. Establishing the role of alpha male
   takes time, but can be done more quickly through the process of playing
   and interacting with your dog.

   When you play with your husky-in-training, you must demonstrate that it
   the toy is yours before your dog can play with it. Hold the toy up to
   your dog and then put it down on the ground for them to play with.
   Don’t give up when you are playing with them. If you are playing
   tug-of-war, your husky-in-training should not be allowed to win. He
   must understand that you are higher-ranking than he is. If you don’t
   accomplish this, then she will not treat you with respect and respond
   to your commands.

   This method of training might seem harsh to some owners. However, when
   beginning Siberian husky training, this method is the closest to being
   perfect. If you are going to race with these dogs, they must understand
   your orders, both for your safety and the safety of your dogs. If they
   don’t follow your commands, it might just make the difference between
   life and death.

   When trying to show your dog that you are the alpha, remember that you
   also have to be gentle. One major difference between husky training and
   normal dog training is that you must also work to show your dogs that
   you can be trusted as well. When huskies do something bad, they should
   be told that verbally, but then given a dog training treat. This is
   proved to give important motivation to the working dogs, while also
   explaining what they did wrong.

Siberian Husky Training: The next steps

   Sled dog training is hard and difficult and takes a lot of time.
   Training Siberian huskies requires you to establish goals for your
   dogs, yourself, and make a commitment. If you are not committed to this
   training, it will not work out so well and can prove dangerous if you
   do try to race or practice sledding with your dog if he is not trained.

   If you are training Siberian huskies, I would recommend you seek advice
   from dog obedience training schools in your area about how to train
   dogs to race pulling sleds. There are experts out there that can help
   you learn how to train your puppy to become a successful athlete.
