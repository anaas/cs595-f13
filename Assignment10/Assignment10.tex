\begin{answer}{1}
In my approach to work this assignment I used some functions which available at chapter six of our text book\cite{source} and used the \url {http://www.salary.com/personal/feeds/slideshow_feed.xml} from \cite{blog}. I save the xml page in a file called {\it feedlist.xml}\footnote{File uploaded to github}. I Created four different categories for the first 100 entries in the feed and classified them manually base on the following classification:
\begin{itemize}
\item salary: pay, paid, cash.
\item job: employee, employer, work, worker, coworker, boss.
\item career: idea, gift, career, goal, dream, suggestion.
\item resume: train, profession, instruct, teach, application, expert.
\end{itemize}


In first program {\it Q1.py} I used {\it getwords} function, the class {\it class classifier} from \cite{source} and the {\it feedlist.xml}\footnotemark[1] file.
the program dose the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Looping over the feed to read the entries from feedlist.xml and generates the word counts for each entries.
\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=9, lastline=22]{Q1.py}

\item Train the classifier with my chosen categories.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=64, lastline=69]{Q1.py}
\item Loop over the entries and manually identifies a category for each of them and print the result which saved in a file called {\it ActualCateg.txt}. 
\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=71, lastline=99]{Q1.py}

\end{itemize}


\end{answer}

\begin{answer}{2}

I add class {\it fisherclassifier} from \cite{source} to the program in question 1 and run the program from file call {\it Q2.py}\footnotemark[1]. This program will do the same as in question 1 and will do the following additional tasks:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The first fifty entries with its categories used to train the classifier.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=232, lastline=234]{Q2.py}

\item Looping over the second fifty entries and get the predicted category for each entry from fisher classifier and train the classifier with each category prediction. Print the  result of both, the actual and the predicted category, and save them in file called {\it PredictActualCatprob.txt}.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=237, lastline=245]{Q2.py}


\end{enumerate}


Table 1 shows the results of title, the cprob(), predicted category, and actual category.

For Q4 I used the function {\it entryfeatures} obtained from \cite{source}. It works on
types more complicated than just strings where it takes the whole entry. In this function pairs of consecutive words are added as features. This function can be run from file called{\it Q4.py}\footnote{File uploaded to github}.
