 Mike Rowe, star of the hit TV show "Dirty Jobs," knows a thing or two about work. He's had more than 300 jobs over the last seven years, ranging from making bricks to castrating sheep. So who better for Wendy and Aaron to talk to than a guy whose life and livelihood is work? In addition to the TV show, Mike talks about the "America's dysfunctional relationship with work," the skilled labor shortage and what his website, www.mikeroweWORKS.com, is doing about the problem. A very funny, insightful and irreverent interview with a man who takes his, and all work, seriously.

 We all know men are paid more than women on average. But part of the reason for that is women negotiate far less often than men. Linda Babcock, author of "Women Don't Ask: The High Cost of Avoiding Negotiation--and Positive Strategies for Change," talks about why women shy away from negotiating, what's at stake and how they can improve. Babcock's expert advice is not only for women, but also those who have female employees.

 Talking about salary is always tricky. Bring it up too soon and you might screen yourself out of an interview. Put it off too late and you could be at a disadvantage towards the end. And sometimes---as is the case with this week's guest---your hand is forced because your salary is a matter of public record. So what do you do if you're going for your dream job but your current job has paid you peanuts? Are you at a disadvantage because they don't take you as seriously? If so, how can you make sure you don't get lowballed? As always, our expert Jack Chapman has your answers!

 Getting a job offer is great, but then comes the task many people dread: negotiating salary. We surveyed 2,000 people to find out how often people negotiate during the interview process and performance reviews, and how they feel about negotiating in general. It turns out a significant number of people never negotiate, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table. Also, check out the differences between men and women regarding negotiation.

 The first rule of negotiation is wait to talk salary until you have a job offer. Because if you slip up and give a number too early in the process, you could end up screened out of a good job. That's what happened to the author of this week's "Ask the Salary Expert" question, who wound up on the outside looking in after giving a salary range before a job offer was made. Our expert, Jack Chapman, explains how to get out of this predicament and back into the job interview.

The 12 in-demand jobs profiled in this article show how you can make some green -- while going green.

 </a>Everyone's had mornings when they'd rather stay in their bunny slippers and gloat at the traffic reports while sipping coffee and working from their home office. But in the past (let's call it the dark ages), some bosses considered working from home a euphemism for doing errands and only allowed it in the event of major plumbing or medical emergencies. Fortunately, progress in technology has made it possible to stay in your PJs and also be productive. Here's a surefire way to get even the most stubborn boss to let you give teleworking a try.

 </a>Even though most states found themselves creating massive cuts in the last year, the budget gap is still too much for some to handle, leading them to decrease spending further. States such as Indiana and California have already announced a dramatic decrease in education budgets for the next year. Both states, especially California, had a hard year in 2009 trying to fill the debt gap. While California inflicted dramatic tuition increases that led to student protests and media scrutiny to make up for the budget, Indiana cut programs and limited faculty travel as a way of spending less, promising to do everything they could to keep tuition increases at a minimum.

 </a>The current economy requires major cuts across the board, and education is taking one of the hardest hits. Although the White House recently reported that the stimulus package was able to save or create 250,000 teaching jobs nationwide, massive layoffs continue to dominate headlines. In addition to faculty layoffs, students are even finding their programs cut, enrollment slashed and calendar year shortened, leaving parents to wonder what other options are out there to ensure their child is getting the best education possible.

 </a>Recent budget constraints have left states having to cut funding left and right, higher education is no exception. The College Board recently released statistics that not only reveal some dramatic tuition increases, but the lull in enrollment for four-year institutions.
